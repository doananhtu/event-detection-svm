EVENT : After they hoisted the soldier in the truck, the two Iraqis -- one an officer, the other an NCO -- ran back to the facility and began treating the other wounded without regard for their safety
EVENT : After they hoisted the soldier in the truck, the two Iraqis -- one an officer, the other an NCO -- ran back to the facility and began treating the other wounded without regard for their safety
EVENT : When the dust settled and the mess tent had been evacuated, everybody who could talk was questioned about their health
EVENT : When the medics came to the two Iraqis, the ING soldiers only wanted to know how everybody else was
EVENT : No matter what the MSM tries to tell you, there are Iraqi's who will help the allies, who will fight alongside them and put their lives at risk to make sure Democracy succeeds in their country
EVENT : This brings to mind a speech Prime Minister Tony Blair gave recently while visiting Iraq
EVENT : There are people dying in Iraq, but the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying to make this country better
EVENT : There are people dying in Iraq, but the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying to make this country better
EVENT : There are people dying in Iraq, but the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying to make this country better
EVENT : And those people from that electoral commission that I described as the heroes of the new Iraq--every day . . . a lot of them aren't living in the Green Zone, they've got to travel in from outside
EVENT : They do not know at any point in time whether they're going to be subject to brutality or intimidation, even death, and yet they carry on doing it

EVENT : The FBI is looking into two incidents in Colorado Springs, Colo., and one each in Cleveland, Washington, Houston, Teterboro, N.J., and Medford, Ore., according to federal and local law enforcement and transportation officials, some of whom spoke only on condition of anonymity
EVENT : A federal law enforcement official, who declined to be identified by name, said Thursday there is no evidence of a plot or terrorist activity
EVENT : But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons
EVENT : Laser beams can temporarily blind or disorient pilots and possibly cause a plane to crash
EVENT : The Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo--which launched the infamous Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995--was discovered to have experimented with the use of lasers as weapons
EVENT : But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons
EVENT : Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training, altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat, and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks
EVENT : However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports
EVENT : That's not the sort of thing you pick up at a military surplus store
EVENT : It sounds like an organized effort to cause airline accidents," Thompson said
EVENT : Michelle Malkin has a post about this today where some outlets have stopped selling lasers
EVENT : A more frightening scenario is that terrorists may have obtained a Chinese-produced ZM-87 laser blinder which is specifically designed to blind eyesight
EVENT : Cult members apparently obtained laser design information from Russian institutes they visited and built a laser weapon mounted on a truck
EVENT : They had planned to use the laser against Tokyo policemen, but the plan failed when the laser malfunctioned during the testing stage
EVENT : I found the following report that was presented to Congress recently about the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners, which this might very well be a precursor to: Recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), referred to as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), pose to commercial airliners
EVENT : However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports
EVENT : While this legislation is still under consideration, Homeland Security appropriations designated $60 million in FY2004 and $61 million in FY2005 to fund a program to develop and test prototype missile countermeasure systems for commercial aircraft based on existing military technology
EVENT : The FBI, concerned that terrorists could use lasers as weapons, is investigating why laser beams were directed into the cockpits of seven airplanes in flight since Christmas
EVENT : One is the death of Yasser Arafat
EVENT : But since Arafat's death, Europeans and Americans have been able to find common ground: supporting Ariel Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza, putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections and, covertly, backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinian leader
EVENT : But since Arafat's death, Europeans and Americans have been able to find common ground: supporting Ariel Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza, putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections and, covertly, backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinian leader
EVENT : A second reason is Europe's growing worries about Islamic terrorism
EVENT : The murder in November of Theo van Gogh, a provocative Dutch filmmaker, at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called Europe's 9/11
EVENT : The Ukrainian election --- complete with its KGB-style poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy-handed electoral fraud -- has reminded European diplomats of Vladimir V. Putin's determination to control his "near abroad
EVENT : The Ukrainian election --- complete with its KGB-style poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy-handed electoral fraud -- has reminded European diplomats of Vladimir V. Putin's determination to control his "near abroad

EVENT : In a monstrous conflict of interest for a supposed straight news reporter, Fasulo acknowledges Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation and Better World Campaign for "their generous financial support" of her book project
EVENT : She also thanks the Rockefeller Brothers Fund "for helping to fund the project
EVENT : It seems a supposed straight shooting reporter with NBC was taking money to fund a book that is so pro-united nations that its almost sickening to read
EVENT : Its U.N. reporter has been on the payroll of the U.N. lobby
EVENT : Actually, the pro-U.N. lobby paid for it
EVENT : Why would an NBC reporter (who also reports on the U.N. for National Public Radio) take money from the U.N. lobby
EVENT : Linda Fasulo, the U.N. correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC, has written a pro-U.N. book, An Insider's Guide to the U.N. , which reads like the U.N. paid for it
EVENT : Perhaps because longtime NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw put his stamp of approval on the UNA-USA and BCUN by acting as master of ceremonies at their 2001 Global Leadership Dinner
EVENT : Another endorsement of the book comes from Barbara Crossette, former New York Times bureau chief at the U.N. who now writes for U.N. Wire, a Ted Turner-funded online news service that covers the U.N
EVENT : In an April 30, 2001, Washington Times column, Nat Hentoff noted that the media have devoted "scant mention" to the "plain fact that it was Mr. Annan, when he was head of the United Nation's peacekeeping office, who could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and their sympathizers in Rwanda in 1994
EVENT : It's true, Hentoff said, that the U.N. issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged, to some extent, its role in the killings
EVENT : A fascinating part of the book is how Fasulo manages to gloss over Annan's role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda
EVENT : She admits, however, that, "The Rwanda massacres occurred while Annan was U.N. Undersecretary General for peacekeeping," and that "After he became SG [Secretary General], Annan commissioned a report to examine what had happened and suggest remedies
EVENT : The informant offered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be used in the genocide campaign
EVENT : It denied authorization for the mission and told him that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness over to the Rwandan government which was planning the genocide
EVENT : The result was that the information dried up and the genocide took place
EVENT : Yup, good ole Kofi told this poor guy to give the secret info over to the very government that was planning the genocide
EVENT : But for five and a half years, he noted, Annan "refused to accept any responsibility for the Rwandan holocaust until Mr. Gourevitch and others revealed that less than 5,000 U.N. troops could have stopped the killings if Mr. Annan had not closed his eyes
EVENT : She tries to blame the U.S. and other members of the Security Council for not sending enough troops to stop it
EVENT : Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to Kofi Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned
EVENT : The truth is that, as director of U.N. peacekeeping, Annan personally refused requests to authorize U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda to seize weapons and prevent genocide
EVENT : Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to Kofi Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned
EVENT : He asked for that approval but the answer came back in a now-infamous "genocide fax" from Annan's office
EVENT : The American rift with Syria deepened this week, with suspicions that Syria might have been behind the assassination of Lebanon's former prime minister in Beirut on Monday

EVENT : In the past two weeks, the officials said, France has rebuffed appeals by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the Israeli foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, to list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, which would prevent it from raising money in Europe through charity groups
EVENT : Israeli and American officials say that the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has told them that he, too, regards Hezbollah as a destructive force in the Middle East, one determined to undermine peace talks by supporting militant groups that attack Israelis

EVENT : A European diplomat said the issue of calling Hezbollah a terrorist organization was discussed in Brussels on Wednesday at a meeting of the Clearing House, a unit of the European Union that meets in confidential sessions to review terrorist activities in Europe
EVENT : They don't want to rock the boat now by attempting to starve out the mullahs' terror agent that conducts the proxy attacks against Israel that Iran cannot afford to do itself openly
EVENT : The United States has long called Hezbollah a terrorist organization, but the French, American and European officials said, have opposed doing so, and argue that making such a designation now would be unwise, given the new turbulence in Lebanon
EVENT : Romania voted in the last December, ousting the so-called socialist party PSD (Social-Democratic Party
EVENT : Local leaders did their jobs, but national leaders, pressuring TV stations to lie, associating with old communist ex-president Ion Iliescu, failed to win in big cities
EVENT : Mischie was right to criticize the national leaders, because PSD got a good share in the elections in his area
EVENT : Nicolae Mischie, authoritarian leader of a district organization of the main opposition party, has been jailed
EVENT : His paper was on a political personality of the 19th century and Mischie bought the house where his paper's subject lived
EVENT : PSD is building a strategy for the 4 years to come and they are going to elect a leader
EVENT : It is known that communist leaders die in office (as judges of the U.S. Supreme Court) and Ion Iliescu won't be different

EVENT : Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go stalk the lobby for the girls that are bringing me my Krystals
EVENT : It's now just one day until I hop in the car and head back in time to the loveliest village on the Plains...Auburn, Alabama
EVENT : Can someone tell me why one of my friends or family members hasn't smacked me because of it
EVENT : One thing that made me laugh is that she showed up at her indictment in a fur coat
EVENT : Ummm, am I the only one that learned anything from the Michael Irvin drug trial of the mid 90's
EVENT : It seems that in recent years, instead of doing the people's business, good ole Linda has spent her time stealing over 600 grand in Federal Education funds
EVENT : Schrenko is a scumbag and, although she won't get any actual jail time, I hope the fine she pleads to is at least as much as what she stole
EVENT : Schrenko stole 20 times what Martha Stewart did, and I bet she won't see the wrong side of a jail cell door, and that's sad
EVENT : You never EVER show up at court, especially facing indictment for stealing large sums of money, wearing a fucking FUR COAT
EVENT : Schrenko is a scumbag and, although she won't get any actual jail time, I hope the fine she pleads to is at least as much as what she stole

EVENT : This isn't a football game, and it's not two drunken cousins fighting at a family reunion
EVENT : I want to know where the Federal criminal charges against all parties involved are
EVENT : A year ago, the program was in disarray and the coach was one poorly executed plane trip away from being fired by an over-zealous and too empowered booster with a fat checkbook
EVENT : This despite several late hits to the head, low hits at his knees and ankles, and various other assaults outside the realm of good sportsmanship

EVENT : After many minutes lying motionless on the field, Ferguson was finally removed via stretcher, giving a thumbs up to the crowd on the way out
EVENT : Coming from the other direction, Jacksonville DB Donovin Darius unloaded chin high on Ferguson with a vicious clothesline
EVENT : This was not one of the staged stiff-armed clotheslines you see in professional wrestling broadcasts
EVENT : This was a vicious, arm cocked and swinging clothesline that literally could have torn Ferguson's head off of his body
EVENT : Paul Tagliabue must give word to all of his employees that actions like this will not be tolerated
EVENT : One sidenote here is that, despite their rabid fandom and the situation, not one thing was thrown at the offending player as he left the field
EVENT : This was the most vicious and blatantly dirty play I have seen in the NFL since Jim McMahon was body slammed to the ground in the mid 80's about five seconds after he had released a pass
EVENT : I don't care what anyone says about "you can't judge intent." Darius' intent was to dismember, injure or even kill Ferguson
EVENT : I don't care what anyone says about "you can't judge intent." Darius' intent was to dismember, injure or even kill Ferguson
EVENT : I don't care what anyone says about "you can't judge intent." Darius' intent was to dismember, injure or even kill Ferguson
EVENT : In this day and age of bigger, stronger and faster players, injuries are going to happen accidentally all of the time
EVENT : There is simply no room for the kind of play that resulted in Ferguson's injury
EVENT : If not, I fully expect the Packers and many other teams to handle this matter "on the field" with Darius being the target of similar attacks by tight ends and offensive lineman
EVENT : I plan to call her this morning and tell her the total, complete with my rental car for a week
EVENT : I'm taking cars to the shop for things that are not my fault
EVENT : I will return this piece of shit on Friday, only to rent another vehicle Monday morning while we take the wife's car to the shop to get her 1400 bucks worth of damage repaired
EVENT : A year ago, Tuberville was one reporter's abililty to find an out of place airplane in Ohio away from being fired BEFORE the Alabama game
EVENT : Then, the AD and President get canned, a booster starts down the long road to shun-ville, and Tuberville keeps smiling and saying the right things
EVENT : He talks his two running backs and two stellar DB's into staying, then knocks out 15 straight wins and signs one of those super iron-clad contracts that will pay him 14 million over seven years, and if Auburn even thinks...THINKS about letting him go, they owe him every penny

EVENT : He could have sex with an endangered Bald Eagle, and they'd STILL have to pay him
EVENT : Much like the "I told you so's" everyone is throwing at the UGA basketball program after their hiring and subsequent firing of The Harricks, folks around the Buckeye state have to be having similar thoughts

EVENT : It seems that AD and frequent "No we didn't" Ohio State front man Andy Geiger is "retiring" after 11 years at the helm
EVENT : Of course, it was discovered that his men's basketball coach had directly given six grand to a Yugoslavian recruit, but that was just his stipend for travel and coach Jim O'Brien was just having a problem with the currency exchange rates...right Andy
EVENT : Allegations have come to light that several OSU players received illegal benefits including cash, access to cars, etc
EVENT : It shouldn't surprise Buckeye fans either, since Tressel had similar problems at Youngstown State, and left a wake of controversy behind himself there as well, including (surprise) illegal benefits including cash, cars, grade fixing, etc
EVENT : The first thing that needs to happen is that Bettman and Goodenow (the players' association rep) need to be fired, deported, flogged, tarred and feathered and finally forced to pay for four tickets plus a program, four dogs, four beers, and two cokes and parking to a game at an NHL arena for every day of the next season so they understand what the fans go thru to see a hockey game
EVENT : That means no team would own any player, and the owners would be free to sign whomever they'd like using the "fiscal restraint" they all droned on and on about all year

EVENT : Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia , a company whose name is so breathtakingly self-promoting it makes me long for the days when every single entity involve in real estate or casinos was called Trump, continues to soar; it rose $1.78, or 7.29%, on news that the company's namesake will star in a new TV show once she, er... gets out of prison
EVENT : Now, I know there have been succesful companies that dealt with crooks (Warner Communications, which started as a merger between business in the three most mob-influenced industries around, comes to mind), but it's a gamble and not a business strategy
EVENT : The company's performance wasn't all that hot even before the CEO went to prison, and until very recently the stock price reflected that
EVENT : And she's been convincted of obstruction of justice
EVENT : This runup is based on the inexplicable hope that now that the head of the firm and the embodiment of a much-resented brand is no longer doing time for lying to the Federal government, they'll be able to really coin some money
EVENT : You have company coming over for dinner
EVENT : You're hosting a wedding reception
EVENT : That business is O-V-E-R -- Between pay-per-view, video-on-demand, pirated movies, high-bandwidth Internet broadcasts, and the increasing availability of other media, it takes some faith to see any future for movie rentals
EVENT : Of course, there have been companies whose performance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea, but Psuedo.com failed without producing a single show, and Broadcast.com was swallowed for $6 billion by Yahoo!, to Yahoo!'s great regret
EVENT : Of course, there have been companies whose performance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea, but Psuedo.com failed without producing a single show, and Broadcast.com was swallowed for $6 billion by Yahoo!, to Yahoo!'s great regret
EVENT : The recent rumors about WalMart's plans to buy out a shipping company have given rise to the fear that the company may go the conglomerate route
EVENT : So Oracle and Peoplesoft , who spent the last 18 months insulting one another in every imaginable way, are finally tying the knot
EVENT : Ellison is brilliant enough to make this merger work, but he's crazy enough to wreck even the soundest of deals
EVENT : I'll have to stick with condemning the merger as a totally unworkable deal between two sides who absolutely hate each other
EVENT : And I won't dwell on the irony of an Oracle employee being driven out of Oracle, starting his own company, and forcing Ellison to spend $10.3 billion to get his company -- but not him -- back (though it does rather delightfully remind me of Coca-Cola basically giving away the bottling franchise and then spending billions to buy it back

EVENT : How much of Peoplesoft's most valuable -- human -- resources will walk out the door the day their options vest
EVENT : Needless to say, Wynn sold when everyone else bought, and he made it through the cannibalizing near-collapse those casinos faced in the early 90's
EVENT : The company intended to use the cash to pay an artificially low price for Yukos assets
EVENT : The company intended to use the cash to pay an artificially low price for Yukos assets (hence that firm's bankruptcy filing a few days ago -- you know it's bad when you have to use US courts to protect your own assets from appropriation by your home country
EVENT : It turns out the anonymous company, BaikalFinansGroup, shares an address with OOO Tverneftemash, which was recently bought by ZAO Gazpromgeocomservice, not to ever be confused by the similarly-named Gazprom (which by the way has a similar logo
EVENT : Auctioneers reported a $9.3 billion winning bid for Yuganskneftgaz -- the company's main asset, worth two to three times that amount -- by an anonymous company located in Tver
EVENT : Gazprom may have arranged some last-minute debt financing, or might have an outside partner, but I seriously doubt they weren't in some way involved with the company that won the auction
EVENT : everyone thinks they can always sell to someone dumber
EVENT : Anyway, I still think the Vioxx risk is overestimated -- if the tobacco industry can sell something with no health benefits for years, get sued, and 1) Keep the product on the shelves, 2) Remain in business, and 3) do 2) to the tune of several billion dollars per year in profits, we Merckers might be safe
EVENT : It's a dying organization, and this will be just the jolt it needs for another couple decades of somnambulant staggering before being ultimately replaced by far more efficient companies
EVENT : The Capital Spectator reports on the latest: Not only China, but India's state oil company has decided to get into the Yukos-dismemberment trade
EVENT : Frenetic merger and acquisition activity doesn't mean much in the early days of a business -- it's just as likely that ridiculously overfunded startups are buying out their bankrupt competitors to create larger and less stable conglomerates as it is that forward-thinking visionaries are cutting off their competitors early

EVENT : But when an outsider buys into the business once it's established itself as important, but before it's really gotten profitable, it's big news
EVENT : For now, it's just a rumor that Ask Jeeves is buying Bloglines
EVENT : Apparently Yuganskneftegaz, which was sold to an independent buyer who turned out to be an apparatus of the state (yes, the same state that 1) forced Yukos to do the auction, and 2) ran the auction, not that 3) this is suspicious or anything), and which was then being bought with foreign assistance, is not being bought with foreign assistance
EVENT : As of this morning, at least. Anyway, it looks like they're denying Chinese involvement to avoid a lawsuit , which is funny -- you'd think they might know someone in the Russian judiciary who could help them out
EVENT : Today, Ask Jeeves made their official announcement about acquiring Bloglines
EVENT : And this is, as far as I know, the first time since the Allegheny deal that there's been a hostile takeover using debt
EVENT : And now, they're swallowed by Just Another Monolith
EVENT : And then MCI just sort of accepted a Verizon deal without really bothering anybody
EVENT : Will we have that at the Fed, when Greenspan leaves
EVENT : Northshore Management, the hedge fund firm accused of stealing millions of dollars in client funds, is now facing actual SEC action
EVENT : Though, of course, there's always the chance that these fund managers were stupid and shortsighted, not actually criminal; apparently, the money stolen was lent to or invested in companies the managers controlled -- so they're guilty of front-running, at the least
EVENT : While North Carolina's excise tax is only 5 cents, the total taxes given to North Carolina by smokers adds up to more than 61 cents per pack
EVENT : Okay, okay -- since the tobacco companies pay lots of money to the states, that's technically accurate
EVENT : I'd love to call it a classic raid -- he's making an offer for the company, nominating his own board, claiming management can accept one or the other or both, and hinting that if they paid him enough, he'd probably go away
EVENT : In this case, the most interesting twist is that he's shorting shares of Mylan's acquisition target, King Pharmaceuticals; he's basically doubling down on the bet that they won't acquire
EVENT : Not only that, but if Mylan bought him out, they'd have less money to fund a purchase of King Pharmaceuticals

EVENT : In this case, the most interesting twist is that he's shorting shares of Mylan's acquisition target, King Pharmaceuticals; he's basically doubling down on the bet that they won't acquire

EVENT : Our president has repeatedly, for example, relied on a man whom you're aware, Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, leader of the Iraq arms program who defected for a time
EVENT : Bob, one of the reasons I think so many Americans are worried about this war and so many people around the world don't want to go is there have been a lot of problems with credibility from this administration
EVENT : The fact that this guy was such an idiot to go back and let his father-in-law kill him shows he wasn't the most stable of people
EVENT : Let me tell you, what trips to Walter Reed taught me was, that whoever thought up the term, the law of unintended consequences it pertains to war

EVENT : Over 80,000 Americans, 220 every day die from medical negligence, hundred of thousands are injured
EVENT : That runs against the fact that so many of them are just leaving their practice because they can't afford it
EVENT : And what we're finding now is that the emergency rooms are closing, trauma centers are closing, pregnant women can't find a doctor to deliver the baby, a boy knocked unconscious has to be transported to another state
EVENT : The patient had to be airavacked and by that time it was too late to prevent the brain damage
EVENT : Well, as much as they've poured into those coffers, it's much less than what the doctors, the malpractice insurers, the hospital chains and the HMOs and the nursing home chains have poured into members of Congress' coffers
EVENT : Are we going to allow severely injured people who have found a lung taken out that's the wrong lung or a double mastectomy that wasn't indicated that was inflicted on a woman in the Midwest, or that organ transplant that was incompatible on that 17-year-old teenager in North Carolina

EVENT : She died awaiting surgery
EVENT : Does that look like a Lottery winner to you, holding a picture of his dead baby
EVENT : But I wonder if you can respond to Mr. McCormick's point. Who are you, who's our president to tell him that his suffering is only worth $250,000 for the loss of a child

EVENT : The average number of suits against a neurosurgeon is five in South Florida
EVENT : If harmed by a doc, they ought to be able to recover their economic costs, economic losses
EVENT : Let me set aside the hypocrisy of a man who became president because of a lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else's lawsuits, but instead focus on his own experience
EVENT : And the entire pay-out to all of the victims that get a little money, not the 90 percent who never file a claim, amounts to less than what we spend on dog food
EVENT : It's about $5.4 billion is the pay-out
EVENT : payoffs have been stable, adjusted for inflation, National Practitioners Databank
EVENT : Both the AMA and the Bush administration released reports this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of their practices all across the country
EVENT : President Bush points this way today, even the most frivolous of lawsuits cost money, premiums go up and either way, the patient pays

EVENT : It has refused in the last five years to revoke the license of a single doctor for committing medical errors
EVENT : If there are any bad doctors we want them removed from the practice of medicine
EVENT : Doctors are leaving practice because of insurance premium, right
EVENT : Well, let's look at what the president is actually proposing for people who have been harmed by a bad doctor
EVENT : Seventy percent of the cases filed are told there's no payment
EVENT : Because someone pays money in a case, the insurance company may pay money because they're afraid there's is going to be a giant award in this case because of this broken liability system
EVENT : But here in Washington, President Bush says it's all a hoax, and many believe he has already made up his mind to go to war
EVENT : Congressman Sanders, you're opposed to this war
EVENT : When the guns begin to fire, when the American men and women are in harm's way and may be dying, is that now the time for you and your allies to shut up and support the troops
EVENT : Well it's not -- are you suggesting that when tens and thousands of Iraqi women and children are killed, and when young men and women in this country are unnecessarily put at harm's risk, what should we do
EVENT : And obviously we're going to pray that there's fewer casualties
EVENT : Are you going to demonstrate against them in the streets

EVENT : I'm not crazy about it myself
EVENT : No, it's so important -- you know this -- and I know it's fun and we love doing partisan Punch & Judy, but is there ever a time when we stand up even if we respectfully disagree with the commander in chief and those who would wage war
EVENT : For example -- wait a second -- in Iran, the reason that you had Ayatollah Khomeini in power is he overthrew the Shah
EVENT : You who put the Shah in power
EVENT : But the problem with Khomeini was that the guy who he overthrew was put in power by the United States
EVENT : But the problem with Khomeini was that the guy who he overthrew was put in power by the United States
EVENT : We overthrew (UNINTELLIGIBLE) and put the Shah of Iran in power
EVENT : We overthrew (UNINTELLIGIBLE) and put the Shah of Iran in power
EVENT : But I mean you're attacking the CIA for putting him in, when it was -- the problem was Khomeini
EVENT : The way we caught that guy was by coordinating with our allies
EVENT : The same weekend they arrested the guy, we had
EVENT : And I'm curious, how can Democrats claim that President Bush is ignoring the war on terror if al Qaeda's second key operative was just caught
EVENT : We had no part in it
EVENT : No, it was a joint effort by Pakistan
EVENT : Why do we want to sever that relationship with this idiotic war in Iraq

EVENT : We don't need war
EVENT : They're not pointing out that inspections are working only because there's the credible threat of war
EVENT : The essence of the American case for war against Saddam Hussein
EVENT : President Bush wants the Security Council to explicitly authorize force against Iraq, and his press secretary today remained optimistic that in the end, that's just what he'll get
EVENT : It doesn't mean we have to go to war
EVENT : But I think President Bush should get credit for pushing to instructions and backing them up with the threat of force
EVENT : It means when you take the threat of force of the table, you're likely to stop disarming Saddam Hussein
EVENT : Yes, I'm not saying take the threat of force
EVENT : I'm saying we don't need to use force right now
EVENT : Saddam wouldn't be destroying missiles unless he thought he was going to be destroyed if he didn't
EVENT : Well, those of you who still believe the myth of the liberal media should consider this: MSNBC, an obscure cable channel, has fired Phil Donahue, the host of its highest-rated show
EVENT : Phil Donahue was fired because he's a liberal
EVENT : A memo from inside NBC, reported on the Web site allyourtv.com, and today in "The Washington Post," shows NBC big wigs feared that the liberal Mr. Donahue represented in the words of the NBC memo -- quote -- "a difficult public face for NBC at a time of war, while our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity because he seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti-war, anti-Bush and skeptical of the administration's motives

EVENT : In a moment, we'll ask two members of Congress if they're convinced that war is the only way to make Saddam Hussein disarm
EVENT : Later, the pope practices religion and a little anti-war politics on the side
EVENT : Congressman Rangel, a couple of months ago Senator Daschle on CBS said -- made the charge that we are, quote, "we haven't made any real progress in the war against al Qaeda
EVENT : And how'd they get them
EVENT : Secretary of State Colin Powell goes to the U.N. tomorrow to do what he can
EVENT : We're talking with potential war in Iraq with Congressman Charlie Rangel, a New York Democrat and his fellow New Yorker Republican Congressman Peter King
EVENT : One of the reasons that we like having you on, and as well as Mr. Rangel, is that, you know, this is war, as we were saying in the last segment
EVENT : You treat it with the gravity and the seriousness that it deserves
EVENT : Isn't that wrong in a time of war
EVENT : You treat it with the gravity and the seriousness that it deserves
EVENT : One of the most admired men in the world is doing everything he can to avert the horror of war
EVENT : If they don't have the pencil that's keeping score, they ought to keep their mouth shut because as a former federal prosecutor, every drug dealer I busted was the most important drug dealer in the world
EVENT : You just pass out numbers on whoever you arrest
EVENT : Because he helped plan the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon
EVENT : Let me tell you, when you arrest somebody, you describe who you're arresting
EVENT : Listen, we should be arresting a lot of people
EVENT : We should do all of those things, but the most important thing is we should not have the arrogance to have a preemptive strike against a defenseless nation without the
EVENT : They have it and we supported them having it when they were fighting Iran so it's no big deal there
EVENT : And the thing is that if we can disarm them without actually going there, killing them, I really think that we maintain our moral authority around the world
EVENT : I mean, what happens if India decides that they could have a preemptive strike against Pakistan
EVENT : I don't think we have to kill to prove that
EVENT : That Europe is against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds, but the U.S. is for the war because it wants to profit for the oil companies
EVENT : I think it's unwise, it's unjust, it's unwarranted, but I don't think it's about oil
EVENT : The people are against it
EVENT : Time now for "Fireback," where our wacky and kooky fans and friends and critics right in
EVENT : Don from Denver, Colorado writes, "Paul, you keep referencing Halliburton selling equipment to Iraq" -- which I do
EVENT : Chad Hensley, from Fairfax, Virginia, writes, "France, Russia and German have all multi-billion dollar oil deals with Saddam in Iraq
EVENT : But it has nothing to do whether we should go to war with Iraq or not
EVENT : I wonder why they protest the war with Iraq
EVENT : That Europe is against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds, but the U.S. is for the war because it wants to profit for the oil companies
EVENT : I don't believe for a minute that this is a war for oil
EVENT : Now, the reason that France, Russia and Germany are against war is because they have democracies
EVENT : He's trying to lead us into a war against one of his valued customers
EVENT : What does that have to do with the war in Iraq
EVENT : On the other hand, the region is pretty unstable, filled with people who already hate Americans and seek to do America harm
EVENT : And I was just curious if you feel that the attack on Iraq would actually open a Pandora's box in other Middle Eastern countries that we are known to aid and harbor terrorists, such as Syria and Iran
EVENT : And my question is, after today's meeting in Paris, where France, Russia and Germany decided to not back a second resolution, who is not (UNINTELLIGIBLE)? Is it the U.S. or is it old Europe
EVENT : Who sends troops to die on our side
EVENT : We know that some of the American troops now fighting in Iraq are longtime veterans of warfare, probably not most, but some
EVENT : So what is it like for them to face combat far from home
EVENT : For an idea, here is CNN's Candy Crowley with some war stories
EVENT : There's nothing very pretty about the training that you take to prepare you for combat, because it is to kill people
EVENT : Staff Sergeant Tom Ridge opened fire
EVENT : A Viet Cong soldier dropped dead
EVENT : Did you at the time or have you since looked back and pondered on killing someone
EVENT : Duke Cunningham was a Vietnam fighter ace shooting down five enemy planes
EVENT : Duke, what's it like to kill somebody
EVENT : And I went to the priest, because it bothered me
EVENT : I knew I could do it again
EVENT : But I didn't know it was going to bother me as much as it did
EVENT : And it still does
EVENT : War may sometimes be a necessary thing, but it can never be a natural thing
EVENT : it
EVENT : Sergeant Chuck Hagel was seriously wounded twice in Vietnam
EVENT : You are trying to kill people, because the alternative is, if you are in combat, you will be killed
EVENT : Training is what keeps you running toward the front while trucks loaded with dead bodies pass you, going the other way
EVENT : Later, when he was wounded and trapped behind enemy lines in Korea, Staff Sergeant Charlie Rangel led 40 men, fighting their way to safety
EVENT : If you're killing people, it's out of fear, not really, in my opinion, out of bravery
EVENT : Rangel, Cunningham, Ridge and Hagel are all proud, decorated combat veterans
EVENT : It's just, a decade later, killing still troubles the soul
EVENT : Did you do it again
EVENT : I shot down four more MiGs
EVENT : As they get ready to head over hostile territory, 10 men aboard this Air Force HC-130 search and rescue and refueling plane start to feel their adrenaline rushing

EVENT : Well, as coalition forces push north, they are encountering a unique problem of combat, getting rid of the weapons captured from the enemy
EVENT : Seemingly deserted, these battered buildings hold a deadly threat to British forces in Iraq
EVENT : What stops though - we know the Iraqis have fired sand missiles and fired AAA at aircraft all throughout this war
EVENT : They haven't hit anybody, but isn't it risky flying so low knowing they have that ammunition to fire at you
EVENT : We know where they're at so we simply avoid them and if for some reason they do get off a lucky shot or they do see us, we have defensive systems on board the airplane to defeat their ammunition
EVENT : The plane arrived back to base safely
EVENT : Eight hundred of those sorties will be strike sorties using bombs and missiles so there is no slow down in the amount of air power being used over Iraq

EVENT : At the Pentagon briefing today, General Stanley McChrystal said that it looked a lot like terrorism
EVENT : It looks and feels like terrorism and what it requires is units to conduct forced production activities which they are prepared and do all the time but clearly when you see a tactic like this, it requires strict adherence or adjustments to your tactics, techniques and procedures to ensure that places like checkpoints are not vulnerable
EVENT : No injuries reported
EVENT : Well, no major concern. The Pentagon says that they do have air dominance as they now call it over the vast majority of the country that there are certain areas and only certain areas of downtown Iraq where battle management radars linked to surface to air missiles are still in tact

EVENT : Well, this is something that we've been trying to get a grip on for years, exactly what the Iraqi people feel and also that I think the best evidence that we had before the attack began was that Iraqis do, they despise
EVENT : They are desperate to be rid of him but by the same token, they don't like another country coming into their country to overturn the government and beyond that, I think it's probably most important for most Iraqis is they're deeply suspicious of the United States
EVENT : Ken Pollack, that resistance that we just saw the British troops dealing with, you and I were talking earlier today
EVENT : The story the last few days has been the surprising level of resistance but you're telling me your sense is that the coalition forces are beginning to adjust to that
EVENT : Chances are the Iraqis are going to continue to stick with what we've seen before, irregular forces blending in with civilians trying to attack U.S. forces, some more of these suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops
EVENT : Chances are the Iraqis are going to continue to stick with what we've seen before, irregular forces blending in with civilians trying to attack U.S. forces, some more of these suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops
EVENT : One last thing, Ken Pollack I want to ask about this British officials saying that they have information that Saddam Hussein has fired his air defense chief
EVENT : Well, if it's true and obviously we don't know just yet but if it's true, it is very significant because it's effectively the Iraqis admitting that many of the civilian casualties that we've seen over the last few days may in fact have been caused by Iraqi surface to air missiles falling back to ground in residential areas
EVENT : Exactly, in that market and I think it was pretty apparent when you looked at the video of that market, if that had been a U.S. bomb or a U.S. cruise missile, that market would have been obliterated
EVENT : Now precisely what they're hitting to the south of us is unclear but my understanding is that there are further Iraqi positions in that direction as well
EVENT : Ben Wedeman describing coalition hits in the area where he is, the town of Kalak in northern Iraq
EVENT : He just called in and we wanted to get this report to you right away
EVENT : Five huge explosions within the space of less than an hour as these planes drop these massive bombs on the Iraqi positions behind us
EVENT : In addition to that, we know that further back behind those lines in the direction of Mosul there is heavy artillery and tanks as well, this according to the people here in this area, the local Kurds who have been going across the lines for many years basically engaged in smuggling

EVENT : Judy, you're seeing us through the night scope because basically for the last hour we've been watching as this ridge behind me in Kalak which of course is the front line between Iraq and Kurdish (ph) forces, we've been watching as planes, planes we can hear but cannot see, have been bombing the ridge line behind us
EVENT : Five huge explosions within the space of less than an hour as these planes drop these massive bombs on the Iraqi positions behind us
EVENT : We've also seen some massive blasts to the south as well so it appears that this bombing in this area continues and we have really seen the most intense bombing of the war in this area in the last 24 hours
EVENT : We've also seen some massive blasts to the south as well so it appears that this bombing in this area continues and we have really seen the most intense bombing of the war in this area in the last 24 hours

EVENT : As our convoy rolled through southern Iraq the desperation of the people here soon became evident
EVENT : In trucks and on foot they came to the town of Safwan
EVENT : When we come back, one of the many sad aspects of this war, humanitarian aid rushed to people who need it but not everybody gets what they came for
EVENT : When we return, Americans this weekend are marching against the war and in support of the troops

EVENT : How do you feel though seeing pictures of civilians injured in the bombings
EVENT : How do you feel though seeing pictures of civilians injured in the bombings
EVENT : We get reports that these civilians especially in the (INAUDIBLE) population have been attacked by the Iraqi regime themselves so they can't blame the American and said look what the American doing to us
EVENT : Mostly small arms fire, but the sand storm has enabled the Iraqis to come very close to the road, and if I sound a little nervous, it's because we're in the soft skin vehicle and everybody else is in armor
EVENT : Of course, you're on an adrenaline high, but racing across the desert, you know that you're traveling toward the jaws of what could be a major military battle
EVENT : Just ahead we'll have the latest on today's suicide bombing in Israel
EVENT : It was the first unit to cross the Euphrates River and then punch northward to within 60 miles of Baghdad

EVENT : There had been many terrorist attacks here in Netanya, including the deadliest suicide bombing ever in Israel almost exactly a year ago, March 27, at the Park Hotel during Passover, 29 people killed in that attack
EVENT : We will be back later on the war in Iraq
EVENT : It had been very quiet inside Israel since the start of the U.s.-led war against Iraq
EVENT : Israel has been on a heightened state of alert since the start of the U.S.-led war against Iraq
EVENT : But first, we want to go somewhere else in the region to tell you that dozens were injured today in the first suicide bombing in Israel in three weeks
EVENT : Dozens, though, injured, including some Israeli soldiers, because according to an eyewitness, he said many soldiers were here also enjoying the spring weather
EVENT : But first, we want to go somewhere else in the region to tell you that dozens were injured today in the first suicide bombing in Israel in three weeks
EVENT : CNN's Kelly Wallace reports on today's attack in Netanya
EVENT : Police say a suicide bomber blew himself up outside this cafe, called The London Cafe, earlier Sunday afternoon
EVENT : As for this attack, the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad is claiming responsibility
EVENT : According to a leaflet from the group obtained by CNN, the group says the attack was to show the union of Palestinians with the people of Iraq
EVENT : And now many Israelis fear they could see more attacks like the one they saw here today as the military campaign against Saddam Hussein continues
EVENT : Many here though say they are relieved only one person dead, the suicide bomber

EVENT : And now many Israelis fear they could see more attacks like the one they saw here today as the military campaign against Saddam Hussein continues
EVENT : Throughout the day, as the U.S. Army 7th Cavalry punched northward in the general direction of Baghdad, we have seen huge convoys of supply troops moving ever northward
EVENT : Additionally, the 7th Cavalry has pushed onward in the general direction of Baghdad
EVENT : There were times when the 7th Cavalry itself got into some skirmishes as it pushed forward, again in the direction of Baghdad
EVENT : U.S. Army's 7th Cavalry is in the forefront of U.S. troops since they first left Kuwait and crossed directly into the Iraqi desert
EVENT : The Apache troop opened its tank guns, opened its own mortars, decimated that unit, put it out of existence and probably killed some 20 Iraqis in the process

EVENT : Earlier in the day, the 1st Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division took Karbala with a minimum of fight
EVENT : There was a bit of a firefight when the 7th Cavalry came upon three Soviet vintage 20- millimeter anti-aircraft guns, ack-ack guns
EVENT : The Iraqi unit in possession of those guns fired mortars in the direction of the 7th Cavalry
EVENT : The Apache troop opened its tank guns, opened its own mortars, decimated that unit, put it out of existence and probably killed some 20 Iraqis in the process
EVENT : This as it continues to push ever closer towards the southern suburbs of Baghdad
EVENT : The speed as they push to Baghdad seems to have gathered pace overnight and in the course of this morning
EVENT : The intensity it's very quick moving, very fluid battle
EVENT : Overnight and early this morning, the tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles of the 3rd Infantry Division backed by the Apache attack helicopters of the 11th Aviation Regiment punched through the Republican Guard defenses in and around Karbala
EVENT : They were then able to advance far north of that city and, as we speak, U.S. commanders tell me that elements of the 3rd Infantry Division are now literally just a few miles from Baghdad
EVENT : That's CNN's Karl Penhaul with the very latest from the battlefront
EVENT : So, in regard to that, we are paying great attention to their ability to defend on the ground
EVENT : The Army's 3rd Infantry has punched through Karbala, meeting only light resistance from the Medina Republican Guard, and moving along highway nine within 25 miles of Baghdad
EVENT : He said, quote, "The dagger is clearly pointed at the heart of the regime now, and it will remain pointed at it," he said, "until the regime is gone

EVENT : Judy, in the next hour, on our special "WOLF BLITZER REPORTS," I'm going to be speaking live to her older brother who is in the Army, her younger sister who wants to be in the Army, just around the same time as Jessica is going to be arriving at Ramstein, the air base in Germany for some serious medical treatment
EVENT : Well, at the Pentagon briefing this afternoon, officials describing several units of the Republican Guard as effectively no longer being a credible fighting force
EVENT : At the same time, the Marines from the 1st Division have secured a key Tigris River crossing near Al Kut and reported to have essentially destroyed the combat fighting ability of that light infantry Baghdad division that was supposed to be providing defense down there
EVENT : Also the Pentagon is seeing lighter than expected resistance indicating at least that they may have really seriously degraded those Republican Guard divisions before the U.S. troops arrived, both in Karbala and also in Al Kut
EVENT : But the Pentagon officials stress that as they close in on Baghdad, this becomes the real dangerous part as they enter that so- called red zone where Saddam Hussein is believed to have given his commanders authority to use chemical weapons, and that use of chemical weapons remains a real fear at the Pentagon
EVENT : We are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it in a coup de mains, or anything like that
EVENT : Additionally, their ability to use chemical and biological weapons, they've proven it historically
EVENT : Clearly, as we threaten the core of the regime, which Baghdad and Tikrit represent, we believe that the likelihood of them using those weapons goes up
EVENT : In less than 24 hours, the U.S. 101st Airborne Division has driven Iraqi Fedayeen fighters from the key city of Najaf, pushed north in a several-pronged attack
EVENT : In less than 24 hours, the U.S. 101st Airborne Division has driven Iraqi Fedayeen fighters from the key city of Najaf, pushed north in a several-pronged attack
EVENT : The Army's 3rd Infantry has punched through Karbala, meeting only light resistance from the Medina Republican Guard, and moving along highway nine within 25 miles of Baghdad
EVENT : Jamie, these descriptions of the weakening of the Republican Guard begin to bring back memories of the first Gulf War 12 years ago
EVENT : Could be urban combat
EVENT : They also are careful to point out that even while they say that the division has been destroyed, they don't mean every single person has been killed
EVENT : They also are careful to point out that even while they say that the division has been destroyed, they don't mean every single person has been killed
EVENT : Could be the most loyal fighters left as they draw into Baghdad
EVENT : Simply that its combat effectiveness has been eliminated - Judy
EVENT : U.S. forces moving ever closer to Baghdad, but military officials say they are not counting on capitulation
EVENT : Now, as you go from Saddam International Airport into town you see there are some big, wide divided highways there
EVENT : I would think, probably, various facilities as well as major government buildings that they need to control to set up a new government
EVENT : A man who has been to Baghdad many times and can tell us with great knowledge exactly what it's going to be like to fight on those avenues in that sprawling city of Baghdad - Judy
EVENT : That means stocks were up today on Wall Street as they look at the progress of the war in Iraq
EVENT : And besides, as soon as you get control of it you'd be able to start using it for air operations, and put a survey team in there as soon as it's secured, and then start using it for helicopter operations, haul forward some big bladders of fuel to refuel helicopters and rearm them and things like that
EVENT : The Shias are a bit gun shy, if you will, in the south because of what happened in 1991
EVENT : They rose up, didn't get American support
EVENT : Colonel Patrick Lang, retired, United states Army, thanks for your insights
EVENT : He's retired with the United States Army
EVENT : A man who has been to Baghdad many times and can tell us with great knowledge exactly what it's going to be like to fight on those avenues in that sprawling city of Baghdad - Judy
EVENT : But American troops and their superior technology have turned out to be a key factor in the fighting there
EVENT : There is much fear here of the Saddam loyalists who still hold sway in Basra and of the invading troops waiting at the gates
EVENT : As coalition forces push ahead in their march toward Baghdad, they have encountered some resistance in the Shiite holy city of Karbala
EVENT : We will approach Baghdad
EVENT : The Americans are racing towards Baghdad, the British still seem anxious to make their progress here as measured as possible
EVENT : These are soldiers of the U.S. 3rd Infantry, fighting near Karbala, southwest of Baghdad
EVENT : And to the south, British forces continue their attack on targets around Basra
EVENT : British troops control the outskirts of the town, and today destroyed another building they said housed Iraqi fighters
EVENT : But there may first be fighting in the capital, 250 miles to the north
EVENT : From the south to the north in the rolling hills of northern Iraq, coalition air strikes targeted Iraqi positions today in what's been called a ferocious bombardment
EVENT : From the south to the north in the rolling hills of northern Iraq, coalition air strikes targeted Iraqi positions today in what's been called a ferocious bombardment

EVENT : This land fell into Iraqi-Kurdish hands without a shot being fired
EVENT : Iraqi soldiers fled these positions in a hurry, under the onslaught of coalition bombing
EVENT : Iraqi soldiers fled these positions in a hurry, under the onslaught of coalition bombing
EVENT : We are now between the lines, a no man's land of abandoned Iraqi bunkers and an unnerving silence, broken by the roar of warplanes and the distant surge of air strikes

EVENT : With U.S. forces rolling closer and closer to Baghdad, the military seems to be zeroing in on the ground war
EVENT : With U.S. forces rolling closer and closer to Baghdad, the military seems to be zeroing in on the ground war
EVENT : I will be talking with a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Joe Biden, just ahead, for his take on how the war is going
EVENT : But, as it has from the beginning, air power remains an important part of the battle
EVENT : In two weeks after the air war began, there is no let-up and no effective response from the Iraqis
EVENT : According to the Air Force, at any given time, there are more 200 coalition aircraft either over Iraq, flying to Iraq or flying from Iraq
EVENT : According to the Air Force, at any given time, there are more 200 coalition aircraft either over Iraq, flying to Iraq or flying from Iraq
EVENT : We can tell you that a lot of pilots of this base are not flying to another base in Iraq
EVENT : It's a base that was taken over by the coalition last week
EVENT : But the are no more Iraqis here, the coalition took over this base last week
EVENT : That air base that coalition forces have now taken control of near Nasiriya
EVENT : And when you arrive there, you are greeted in a sense by Saddam Hussein
EVENT : What's happen is the military personnel who have arrived here have taken out their markers and are writing messages on Saddam Hussein's portrait
EVENT : There is a lot of fighting in this area
EVENT : After he told us that, we asked him during his missions, and he's flown about 30 in the last two weeks, we asked him does he still have any artillery being fired at him
EVENT : Yesterday I was up just south of Baghdad by 30 miles and we were fighting SA-2s and SA-6s and AAA on the ground
EVENT : So they're still out there. But the air power and the air package that we take to the fight, we continue to be effective
EVENT : And when we put our power punch to them and then the Army and the Marines move forward it's a very effective, coordinated effort
EVENT : We want to tell you the Air Force has just informed us that between this morning and tomorrow morning, it will fly 1,900 sorties into Iraq
EVENT : What they are doing, Judy, some of these A-10s behind me go there to refuel, to stage operations further north
EVENT : With the power out now in Baghdad, we're getting word that loudspeakers have been blaring in the Iraqi capital, urging citizens to go to the international airport there, presumably to defend it against coalition forces
EVENT : Now that armored columns of U.S.-led troops have reached the outskirts of Baghdad, eyewitnesses report fighting and shelling around Saddam Hussein International Airport
EVENT : Now that armored columns of U.S.-led troops have reached the outskirts of Baghdad, eyewitnesses report fighting and shelling around Saddam Hussein International Airport
EVENT : In the final push to Baghdad, U.S. forces face limited resistance from Iraqi troops
EVENT : And the way seems to be open for coalition forces to close in on the city's southern limits
EVENT : But the Pentagon believes some Iraqi Republican Guard units have withdrawn to the capital for what could be their last stand
EVENT : Farther south in Basra, smoke rose over the city as coalition vehicles moved in today
EVENT : And in northern Iraq, Kurdish political leaders and members of the Iraqi opposition are engaged in talks with U.S. military commanders
EVENT : The forces encountered limited resistance along the way and are now poised for the final assault not far from the edge of the city
EVENT : Baghdad is now within striking distance as troops make their final thrust through the desert
EVENT : At daybreak, U.S. troops pushed through the outskirts of Karbala on the road to Baghdad, capturing a key bridge on the Euphrates River
EVENT : At daybreak, U.S. troops pushed through the outskirts of Karbala on the road to Baghdad, capturing a key bridge on the Euphrates River
EVENT : These dramatic pictures show a raid on a presidential palace less than 60 miles from Baghdad
EVENT : We don't think that the fighting is over yet, and so there are still options available to the regime, including the use of weapons of mass destruction
EVENT : The Americans say they've destroyed two divisions of the elite Republican Guard
EVENT : The Medina division, which is one of the toughest outfits in the Republican Guard is now down to 10 percent of its fighting strength
EVENT : Others are down to 50 percent, but there's still one or two divisions around 75, 80, 90 percent of their fighting strength, and they could still put up very stiff resistance, indeed, when the American forces get en masse to Baghdad itself

EVENT : Can you tell us what she said to you on the telephone
EVENT : They have no idea at this time what caused them
EVENT : And Colonel Leonhard, we're going to talk a little bit about urban combat
EVENT : Gravity rules, even in urban combat
EVENT : Lieutenant Colonel Robert Leonard, we appreciate your insights in urban combat, something that is not something that the U.S. military would prefer to engage in, but it might become inevitable
EVENT : And I wanted to just start this off by saying a lot of people when they hear about urban combat, they think of that Blackhawk down scenario, Mogadishu and the problems that can go wrong here
EVENT : If we move in on Baghdad, and give you a sense of the kinds of targets that might be encountered in urban combat
EVENT : Lieutenant Colonel Robert Leonard, we appreciate your insights in urban combat, something that is not something that the U.S. military would prefer to engage in, but it might become inevitable
EVENT : And then we'll probably surge fires into their both lethal and nonlethal to make his position untenable, to make him move rather than us moving through the assault zone
EVENT : President Bush vows a final push to victory and he mourns the loss of fallen Marines
EVENT : We are much more likely to use patience and finesse rather than assault tactics
EVENT : It's the side that's moving that's going to take the casualties
EVENT : It's the side that's moving that's going to take the casualties
EVENT : That said, the armored fighting vehicles that you see there they look to me as if they're moving a little bit faster as than we probably will

EVENT : But the final push into the city could yet prove to be the toughest fighting of all

EVENT : But as long as "criticism is anti-semitism" is the mentality, don't act surprised that the Palestinians object to the Lebensraum (a/k/a settlements) and Israeli terrorism (bombings, shooting farmers in their fields, bulldozing crops, destroying schools, shooting children, etc. etc. etc

EVENT : I have contacted the UACC and told them about it so they can check the auctions (she's been doing this a long time) and to tell me if she's actually a registered member
EVENT : The only thing that being a UACC member means is that they paid membership dues
EVENT : LaDouce says e-mails were dispatched to Indonesian officials, but he doesn't know what happened to the information
EVENT : Thousands could die
EVENT : On the other hand, if you were a scientist at NOAA and were into saving people from tsunamis, you would think you might have figured out beforehand who you might call if you did get some advanced warning of such an event
EVENT : You can bet they are figuring out who they should have call next time
EVENT : We just learned that our friend's daughter when to Thailand to visit her father after the wave hit
EVENT : It's too bad those NOAA people hadn't used the telephone
EVENT : I was researching Meg Tilly on the internet and thus accidentally found out that Jennifer Tilly was born Jennifer Chan
EVENT : A political public service message brought to you by Clear Channel
EVENT : Did you know that one of the largest media companies in the country was in the business of bringing you "political public service messages
EVENT : Two of my nephews were excluded from their brother's wedding this weekend because they are not LDS
EVENT : Both were extremely hurt, particularly since they know their brother could have had a civil ceremony and then been married in the temple later
EVENT : I got a sort of an icky feeling when I realized the only people who did attend the kid's wedding was his unmedicated bi-polar mother and his father, who suffers from Alzheimers
EVENT : The religion that is afraid of science dishonors God and commits suicide
EVENT : There's been a thread recently in one of the exMo fora about a woman whose bishop, who she had been planning to have marry her, was going out of town, so she asked the stake president, who she didn't know well
EVENT : He insisted that he needed to make the point, as part of performing the ceremony, that she really needed to be married in the temple, even though her fiance was not LDS
EVENT : Unfortunately we started off on the wrong foot for a lot of reasons and the marriage didn't last
EVENT : I can't help but wonder if perhaps we did ourselves a diservice by not getting sealedi ntially, and making our marriage a gospel focused one
EVENT : For my part though, I think we started the marriage with a compromise and deined ourselves tremendous blessing and ultimately paid the price
EVENT : I know that was what happened with my own parents, largely because their decision to get married and my father's decision to join the church came very close together, and they didn't want to wait the year until he would be able to enter the temple
EVENT : I know that was what happened with my own parents, largely because their decision to get married and my father's decision to join the church came very close together, and they didn't want to wait the year until he would be able to enter the temple
EVENT : Both were extremely hurt, particularly since they know their brother could have had a civil ceremony and then been married in the temple later
EVENT : I really think it's time for the church to admit that a civil ceremony followed by a temple sealing reaches the same goal, often in a more loving way, than insisting that only the sealing is worth doing
EVENT : I chose to have a civil ceremony largely because my wife and I were both converts and a temple ceremony would have excluded both families completely
EVENT : Hmm... I wonder how many success stories are out there from people who chose to have a civil ceremony, and went on later to be happily sealed
EVENT : I wonder if B had a huge messy divorce, and his ex took the kid out of state
EVENT : Perhaps my exwife has more sympathy for what its like to be a guy on the receiving end of a divorce now
EVENT : I think divorce is really stupid
EVENT : Divorce really sucks
EVENT : She wrote an article about a divorce support group, ending it with something about Mrs. B being happily married but she's impressed by the divorce support group

EVENT : I wonder if B had a huge messy divorce, and his ex took the kid out of state
EVENT : She wrote an article about a divorce support group, ending it with something about Mrs. B being happily married but she's impressed by the divorce support group
EVENT : Sometimes we want to see marriage one dimensionally
EVENT : Either its bad or good
EVENT : I know my first marriage had a lot of good adventures, a lot of friendship, a lot of love
EVENT : Oh, yeah, it wasn't perfect
EVENT : I was one of the first digital camera users, and I have too many photos from my first marriage
EVENT : They say it takes one year for every two that you were married
EVENT : Especially for those of us who still have so many years (if one year for every 2 married, then I've still got another 7 or so) to go to get our heads screwed back on and find some sort of life that rivals what we had or what our ex has or what you and your ex have
EVENT : We're going to a bed and breakfast this weekend, to get away, relax
EVENT : If my exwife doesn't dump B, maybe they'll wind up staying together, maybe even getting married
EVENT : My mother took his remarriage harder than I did, I think, because of that
EVENT : I did get a good bunch of the wedding photos, but my ex refused to give them all to me saying it was "his life too" even though I really resent them being under the same roof with his child-bride
EVENT : Dell is involved in a class action suit for "bait and switch", where a nurse claims Dell switched parts and charged her for the more expensive items, and for promising "easy credit" for which no one qualifies and then charges ridiculously high interest rates
EVENT : All class actions do is enrich lawyers and raise costs to everyone
EVENT : The cost of class actions is factored into the cost of everything you buy
EVENT : the only tort reform that i think should be done is to cap fees that lawyers are allowed to extract for class action suits
EVENT : i feel that there is a valuable public service that comes from class actions suits which is to keep companies on the straight and narrow so that they avoid such actions... but from a monetary perspective the only real winners from class actions are the lawyers
EVENT : i feel that there is a valuable public service that comes from class actions suits which is to keep companies on the straight and narrow so that they avoid such actions... but from a monetary perspective the only real winners from class actions are the lawyers
EVENT : Believe it or not there are companies that go over the line and need to be hit with a stick called a law suit
EVENT : It seems the fear of law suits is the only thing that keeps some of these crooked companies in line
EVENT : The only people who profit from class actions are the lawyers
EVENT : Doing the right thing provides no protection from class action
EVENT : i remember once receiving a fifty cent check in an envelope with postage of at least half that amount for the great 17" monitor class action suit
EVENT : i remember once receiving a fifty cent check in an envelope with postage of at least half that amount for the great 17" monitor class action suit
EVENT : Then there was the class action suit against Gateway brought by some Philadelphia lawyers a number of years ago
EVENT : So the lawyers sued Gateway, and the settlement approved by the judge consisted of megabucks for the lawyers and coupons to owners of Gateway 486 computers
EVENT : Since companies are going to be sued in class action, regardless of the merits of the case, the threat of a class action is not a detriment
EVENT : If you don't believe that, witness the Vioxx lawsuits
EVENT : Because of that, it is being sued
EVENT : They are not being sued
EVENT : The Red Cross normally deducts 9% from all deductions for its administratice costs
EVENT : Just give carefully. if you are going to give assistance then LOOK with suspicion at all they do it is better to keep your $$$
EVENT : I would like to make a donation to help the survivors of the tsunami
EVENT : Actually more of the money from your donation has a chance of going directly toward its intended purpose than any other charity
EVENT : I've heard mostly positive things about how the Red Cross is handling their donations, with a very high percentage of the donated funds going directly for relief and not for administrative expenses
EVENT : It has announced that it will forego the 9% on donations earmarked for tsunami relief and that 100% of these funds will go directly toward aid
EVENT : So that is the channel we chose for our own donation
EVENT : 9% in administrative costs would place the Red Cross among charity organizations making the the most efficient use of donated funds
EVENT : Money from private donations has been flowing into charitable relief organizations at an unprecedented rate, in some cases by millions of dollars per hour
EVENT : Although the need for help is still continuing, some individual charities have announced that they have already received as much in donations as they can put to use for this effort
EVENT : This is why we want to let you know that at this time, MSF estimates that we have received sufficient funds for our currently foreseen emergency response in South Asia
EVENT : They also stated that there are lots of places in the world where they continue to work which needs plenty of help too - quite an important reminder because other needy areas of the world are getting less donations now
EVENT : So they didn't discourage donations to them per se, just not for this specific area
EVENT : Oh well, lets cross now to our mob of mindless drones and hear about how good it is that this menace to society is going to be locked up before he kills all our innocent children
EVENT : Oh well, lets cross now to our mob of mindless drones and hear about how good it is that this menace to society is going to be locked up before he kills all our innocent children
EVENT : The way to avoid being charged is to give the keys to someone else to unlock the door and have them hang on to the keys until you're below .05
EVENT : In this case the offender escaped conviction first time around because it was accepted that he attempted to get rid of the keys, which supposedly landed in his lap
EVENT : Or what if I were in a bar with the car outside, keys in my pocket, but I've decided I'll take the train home later
EVENT : The drunk was acquitted on the technicality that he wasn't on a public road when the cop arrested him
EVENT : I'm reminded of when I lived in another state and the local cop charged the town drunk in his driveway after following him home from the pub
EVENT : I'm in charge of getting everyone excited about contacting organizations so Marcella can meet with them
EVENT : Remember to stress that Marcella can either meet with the execs or the whole group (whatever works best), that she will be talking briefly, and that she will be there because she wants to learn about that group's concerns and issues at A&M
EVENT : If they are interested in setting up a meeting then have them contact me at 979-777-6445 or at laurouse...@yahoo.com and I will send the info to Tori, or have them contact Tori Foster to set up a time
EVENT : Also, let me know who you have already contacted and set up a meeting with so that I can make sure we don't call them twice
EVENT : Also, let me know who you have already contacted and set up a meeting with so that I can make sure we don't call them twice
EVENT : Ok guys, sorry for the long e-mail and the rambling, but I want to make sure that I have everything covered
EVENT : We are going to be having a sock painting party at my house instead of the normal meeting at St. Mary's
EVENT : Start on Texas Ave. and head away from Bryan
EVENT : Go down Texas Ave. until you come to South West Parkway

EVENT : Go into second entrance of the complex on left (mailbox should be on right side
EVENT : I am the head of a company that raised an angel round of financing from a San Francisco angel investor who I never physically met initially
EVENT : the CEOS and execs of companies such as Fred Smith of FEDEX, Norman Waitt Of Gateway, Jeff Skoll of Ebay, Roger Marino of EMC, Marc Turtletaub of The Money Store, Marc Cuban/Todd Wagner, and others have all parked their money in film ventures and deals similar to ours
EVENT : I need a similar self made entrepreneur who recently sold his company; is currently at the helm of one; or, a recently exited executive with a large severance pay who is sitting in the middle of nowhere, USA, is bored, and has always secretly wanted to get into the film business for tax, vanity, or alternative investment reasons
EVENT : I have 2 girls already, nearly 8 and 4.5 yrs and I have always said I will NEVER forget the pain of childbirth
EVENT : Abby was a true water birth (3kg - normal) and with Fiona I was dragged out of the pool after the head crowned (gyno had written on my notes she was 4kg (large) and that she was not to be born in the water (long painful story!) I can still remember though the pain I felt
EVENT : Abby was a true water birth (3kg - normal) and with Fiona I was dragged out of the pool after the head crowned (gyno had written on my notes she was 4kg (large) and that she was not to be born in the water (long painful story!) I can still remember though the pain I felt
EVENT : I am on the large side but I am so worried about how I'm going to cope with a natural childbirth without a pool (not available round here
EVENT : If you go for a home birth you can rent a birthing pool
EVENT : So don't give up on the idea of a natural birth because last time was painful
EVENT : If you don't have an institutional water birth available, have you considered just staying home
EVENT : I understand hypnobirthing can be very helpful
EVENT : My girlfriend was on the run from probation in Fla when she got herself in trouble here in Az
EVENT : Az troubles again in 2004, she serves 6 months , then the day before she is to be released to do 5 yrs probation her in az, fla shows up and takes her to fla faceing her original 1999 charges which are still open (she failed miserably at probation
EVENT : 2 "FTA"s (failure to appear), one in FL and one in AZ, plus whatever the original charges were in both cases
EVENT : All the FL prosecutors have to do is ask, and the AZ jailers will pack her up in a van or a plane and ship her back to FL for trial on the FTA charge and probably to commence her serving time under the suspended sentence that went along with her original probation
EVENT : They let her serve her time in AZ, then they come and get her to serve her time in FL
EVENT : It lets them skip some of the legal procedures she would otherwise be entitled to, in order to ship her from one state to another
EVENT : Thumb your nose at the court often enough, and they will bring all sorts of crap down on your head, re-instituting the original suspended sentences and possibly adding on for the FTA
EVENT : But they were entitled to demand that waiver as a condition of probation; if she had not agreed to voluntarily waive that right, they probably would have just thrown her in jail for the 3 year sentence the first time around and she wouldn't have been given the chance to go straight during probation and avoid jail altogether
EVENT : But they were entitled to demand that waiver as a condition of probation; if she had not agreed to voluntarily waive that right, they probably would have just thrown her in jail for the 3 year sentence the first time around and she wouldn't have been given the chance to go straight during probation and avoid jail altogether
EVENT : She will probably have to serve out her sentence in FL, AND if she has not already served all her time in AZ, they will then ship her back there to do THAT time
EVENT : She will probably have to serve out her sentence in FL, AND if she has not already served all her time in AZ, they will then ship her back there to do THAT time
EVENT : Az in trouble in 2001, fla is mentioned and she signs another waiver of extradition, posts bonds and skips (not far enough apparantly
EVENT : Az troubles again in 2004, she serves 6 months , then the day before she is to be released to do 5 yrs probation her in az, fla shows up and takes her to fla faceing her original 1999 charges which are still open (she failed miserably at probation
EVENT : I think they want to give her 3 years
EVENT : Az troubles again in 2004, she serves 6 months , then the day before she is to be released to do 5 yrs probation her in az, fla shows up and takes her to fla faceing her original 1999 charges which are still open (she failed miserably at probation
EVENT : The waiver of extradition that she signed simply means that if she skips out and goes to another state, she can't contest the right of the original court to have her hauled back to its jurisdiction, and that the court won't have to initiate the time-consuming process of extraditing her
EVENT : The waiver of extradition that she signed simply means that if she skips out and goes to another state, she can't contest the right of the original court to have her hauled back to its jurisdiction, and that the court won't have to initiate the time-consuming process of extraditing her

EVENT : On the fourth day of his stay, he was moved out of the ICU to the step-down unit, with a diagnosis of "ICU Psychosis secondary to narcotic administration" and post thoracostomy
EVENT : Then the orderly was apparently rude to him, and that's when he got up and decided to come home
EVENT : At 2:15 the next morning, I received a call from the night shift supervisor who told me my friend had been "verbally abusive and aggressive" and would I come over and talk to him
EVENT : I was given copies of a citation for simple assault and battery, then went to the police station several days later to find out what other paperwork was available on this incident
EVENT : He was cited for simple assault and battery
EVENT : According to the police report, this woman never reported to the ER for verification of the injuries and no one else can verify exactly what happened to provoke this incident
EVENT : During the early evening hours of his sixth hospital day, he got up, dressed, pulled his chest tube out and managed to get out of the hospital and across four lanes of busy evening traffic, to our apartment
EVENT : A short time later, two police officers showed up and told me they had to take him back to the hospital
EVENT : So, I went over there, getting to his room right at 2:30
EVENT : Also, I was looking at both citations, I didn't get to the hospital until 2:30 am, and the officer has the time of incident as being at 2:34 am
EVENT : So, I went over there, getting to his room right at 2:30
EVENT : A nurse said, "He beat two of us up
EVENT : I asked to speak to the two nurses whom he'd alledgedly hit and was told I couldn't do that
EVENT : I was given a copy of a different citation, but with the identical information from the one I'd gotten the night of the incident
EVENT : According to the police report, this woman never reported to the ER for verification of the injuries and no one else can verify exactly what happened to provoke this incident
EVENT : The hospital obviously knew that your friend was having head problems, and they improperly treated him by not sending him to a psych ward, which allowed the situation to get worse until the point where he assaulted someone
EVENT : The cops are here because we're pressing charges
EVENT : He was sent to another hospital with a psych unit until his psychosis resolved
EVENT : I was given copies of a citation for simple assault and battery, then went to the police station several days later to find out what other paperwork was available on this incident
EVENT : The police report has the victim saying she was "choked to where she almost lost consciousness, struck in the face with a belt buckle and it had left large marks, and that he'd grabbed her breasts and left marks
EVENT : The police report has the victim saying she was "choked to where she almost lost consciousness, struck in the face with a belt buckle and it had left large marks, and that he'd grabbed her breasts and left marks
EVENT : The police report has the victim saying she was "choked to where she almost lost consciousness, struck in the face with a belt buckle and it had left large marks, and that he'd grabbed her breasts and left marks
EVENT : According to the police report, this woman never reported to the ER for verification of the injuries and no one else can verify exactly what happened to provoke this incident
EVENT : By the time he got to our home, he was very short of breath and there was a nurse and orderly who told me "he's crazy and just walked out
EVENT : I was given copies of a citation for simple assault and battery, then went to the police station several days later to find out what other paperwork was available on this incident
EVENT : He was cited for simple assault and battery
EVENT : The hospital obviously knew that your friend was having head problems, and they improperly treated him by not sending him to a psych ward, which allowed the situation to get worse until the point where he assaulted someone
EVENT : Sue them for malpractice, and make the number big enough to get some serious attention
EVENT : the bankrupcy filing took place in 2003, but it didnt clear until early 2004 and that was when i gave him the shares
EVENT : Probably not. But if he was required to list the shares in bankruptcy filings, and didn't, the answer may be different
EVENT : I think, though, that any transaction after the bankruptcy filing date is part of his new life
EVENT : Since you gave your uncle the shares prior to his discharge, the shares should have become assets available to the bankruptcy estate for the satisfaction of debts
EVENT : That means that he received the shares while he was still in bankruptcy, which means that the shares were potentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors
EVENT : If, however, your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court, then as a general matter the creditors cannot go after the shares, unless they can prove that there was collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them (e.g., by putting his assets in the corporation's name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him
EVENT : My uncle declared bankruptcy in 2003 and his case closed in June 2004
EVENT : If I give him shares in my corporation in Feb 2004 of my S Corporation making him 30% shareholder, and I finally distributed profit this year, will the creditors attempt to that take money from him in 2005
EVENT : the bankrupcy filing took place in 2003, but it didnt clear until early 2004 and that was when i gave him the shares
EVENT : I believe you had said that you gave him the shares in February 2004 but that the discharge didn't come until June of 2004
EVENT : If I give him shares in my corporation in Feb 2004 of my S Corporation making him 30% shareholder, and I finally distributed profit this year, will the creditors attempt to that take money from him in 2005
EVENT : S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy
EVENT : Re: S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy
EVENT : You need to speak to a bankruptcy attorney pronto; this is a bankruptcy matter, not a tax matter
EVENT : You need to speak to a bankruptcy attorney pronto; this is a bankruptcy matter, not a tax matter
EVENT : Re: S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy
EVENT : Re: S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy
EVENT : Yes, but according to the facts you first gave, he had not yet received the bankruptcy discharge when you gave him the shares
EVENT : A bankruptcy case doesn't close until you get the discharge order, and until then everything that the debtor receives is fair game for the trustee
EVENT : If, however, your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court, then as a general matter the creditors cannot go after the shares, unless they can prove that there was collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them (e.g., by putting his assets in the corporation's name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him
EVENT : A serial killer in Wichita, Kansas who killed at least 8 people in the '70s and '80s
EVENT : BTK stands for bind, torture, and kill
EVENT : I think it's Bind, Torture and Kill
EVENT : I believe Bind Torture Kill = BTK
EVENT : BTK stands for bind, torture, and kill
EVENT : I think it's Bind, Torture and Kill
EVENT : I believe Bind Torture Kill = BTK
EVENT : He sent several letters to the police and the media during that time
EVENT : You do well to wonder why the BTK killer was not captured until yesterday
EVENT : The BTK killer once called up a police dispatcher and told her of the crime he just committed, and still they could not catch him
EVENT : The rich hire private security for a reason--public security is often inadequate
EVENT : What's the deal with parole
EVENT : Getting out on parole is usually a reward for good behavior while serving time
EVENT : Parole is not a right and its granting is discretionary
EVENT : If you get out on parole, what happens then, and how long does it last
EVENT : and, specifically, who takes you home once you get out of jail, or do you just get turfed out and expected to check in with your parole officer the next day
EVENT : and, specifically, who takes you home once you get out of jail, or do you just get turfed out and expected to check in with your parole officer the next day
EVENT : So you're basically free, with the expectation that you will not leave the state (assuming you've been jailed by the state gov't) and you have to check in with your parole officer on a regular basis (I think they give you a schedule
EVENT : Instead, there are ways of getting your parole eligibility date moved up for good behavior, or of creating strong presumptions in favor of parole release
EVENT : Instead, there are ways of getting your parole eligibility date moved up for good behavior, or of creating strong presumptions in favor of parole release
EVENT : Instead, there are ways of getting your parole eligibility date moved up for good behavior, or of creating strong presumptions in favor of parole release
EVENT : Indeed, New York's statute says, "Discretionary release on parole shall not be granted merely as a reward for good conduct or efficient performance of duties while confined but after considering if there is a reasonable probability that, if such inmate is released, he will live and remain at liberty without violating the law, and that his release is not incompatible with the welfare of society and will not so deprecate the seriousness of his crime as to undermine respect for law

EVENT : You have to provide a planned residence when you're considered for parole, usually a relative or program of some kind
EVENT : You can go back to prison for violating the conditions of your parole, for a period of time up until your sentence runs out
EVENT : and, specifically, who takes you home once you get out of jail, or do you just get turfed out and expected to check in with your parole officer the next day
EVENT : And, again fairly specifically (and I realise this is state specific, but I'm kinda looking for a general answer here): if an eighteen year old gets caught selling marijuana to 12-14 year olds, and gets put away for, say, three years, is this the sort of deal where he's likely to get parole, or just do the time and leave again

EVENT : The same group of people who have said "even if some regions are too unsafe for people to go to the polls and even if large portions of the population will not recognize the legitimacy of the outcome, some election is better than no election, and it's a great day for democracy!"...........are suing to overthrow the results of the governor's election is Washington State because there were some "errors" in the process
EVENT : So the standards are: Any old process halfway resembling an election is just diddly dandy in Iraq, but we won't accept the results of a free and fair election in Washington State because there may have been a human error rate of 0.0000001 percent
EVENT : In Washington State, the election has to be not only free and fair, but also "perfect
EVENT : Following the election and recount process exactly as outlined in our state constitution, the democratic candidate won by a margin of less than 200 votes

EVENT : In Iraq, an election takes place in which one of the three major forces vying for control of the country opts out
EVENT : The problem with this election is that no matter what happens the results are going to be tainted and questionable
EVENT : If Lou Dobbs, on CNN, at 6:10 Eastern, can say, "This election was a success by any measure," that's good enough for me
EVENT : You have to start somewhere and this election is to get a legislative body to write a constitution for Iraq
EVENT : Of course, the Republicans would have thought the WA State election *was* perfect, had their candidate held the same 100 and some vote margin when all the smoke finally cleared
EVENT : Everyone, everywhere should have the basic right to elect their government

EVENT : Everyone has heard the story: Beatriz Marinello was elected USCF President on August 11, 2003 in Los Angeles
EVENT : Immediately after she took office, she found out that the USCF had no money in the bank, zero
EVENT : Therefore, on August 20, 2003, bravely Beatriz walked into the USCF Offices in New Windsor and immediately fired 17 staff members
EVENT : Therefore, on August 20, 2003, bravely Beatriz walked into the USCF Offices in New Windsor and immediately fired 17 staff members
EVENT : Of course, it was just a pure coincidence that the 17 people Beatriz fired were the people she had grown to dislike during the year that she worked for the USCF in 1999-2000
EVENT : Had the existence of this $85,000 in a secret bank account been known, it would not have been necessary to fire those 17 people right away
EVENT : Perhaps in the long run it was a good thing to fire them, but it might not have been a good idea to fire them all abruptly, in the same day
EVENT : Perhaps in the long run it was a good thing to fire them, but it might not have been a good idea to fire them all abruptly, in the same day
EVENT : It is no coincidence that the employees let go included substantially all those who had offered to transfer to Crossville, including (remarkably) the employee of the year
EVENT : To make the staff cuts without the system changes was absurd and probably the reason for McCrary &Camaratta's departures
EVENT : He was asked to wait until after the LA meeting was over before resigning
EVENT : John McCrary resigned from the board as a result
EVENT : It took six weeks before the USCF paid the guaranteed prizes the prize winners had won at the US Open

EVENT : For this act of stupidity which had caused a grave crisis in the USCF, the accountant was immediately fired
EVENT : To make the staff cuts without the system changes was absurd and probably the reason for McCrary &Camaratta's departures
EVENT : When I offered to attend the Board meeting in October 2003 to explain and clarify all this, I was told I was not welcome
EVENT : It is no coincidence that the employees let go included substantially all those who had offered to transfer to Crossville, including (remarkably) the employee of the year
EVENT : We also had a buyer for the building at a prize much higher than it was eventually sold for and a commitment for 4% bank financing in Crossville
EVENT : Staff reductions were clearly in the works pending system changes that would be facilitated by any move, Miami, PBG, Crossville or elsewhere
EVENT : Talent was in charge of the CIA when two of the most costly intelligence failures in American history happened -- not recognizing the Sept. 11 plot, and wrongly claiming that Saddam had a stockpile of WMDs
EVENT : Franks was in charge of the operation that was supposed to quickly go in, take over Iraq, and then start moving our troops out rapidly -- at this point I think we're going to see our troops over there at least through the end of the decade

EVENT : I like this quote the best, but I am sure it means nothing to us (us being the US's powers that be)..."The Iranian nation is not looking for war, violence and confrontation," Khatami said
EVENT : I like this quote the best, but I am sure it means nothing to us (us being the US's powers that be)..."The Iranian nation is not looking for war, violence and confrontation," Khatami said
EVENT : so you believe him when he says that iran isn't looking for it, but you don't believe the US when we say that we aren't
EVENT : but when you have a sitting president who has an infatuation with provoking other countries into a war, you can bet that he will try everything he can to try to prove his case against iran
EVENT : that is the type of diplomatic solution that all of the anti-war people wanted for iraq
EVENT : The mid to late 1990's saw the passing of NCA founder Fred Fried, and also that of Charlotte Dinger, both who represented the two opposite points of view in the carousel preservation debate
EVENT : There was talk of a (re)merger but the regulations governing non-profits prevented that
EVENT : Just within the past couple of months though, the American Carousel Society had determined that they did not have the funding to continue with the operation of their organization and officially ceased to exist
EVENT : The National Carousel Association was founded in the early 1970's by a group of art historians and collectors, including Frederick Fried, author of the 1964 book "A Pictorial History of The Carousel" that single-handedly gave the classic hand-carved wooden carousel the respect and appreciation it deserved
EVENT : Swenson herself would also leave the NCA
EVENT : Meanwhile, those collectors who left the National Carousel Association banded together to form the American Carousel Society (ACS), whose stated aims of carousel preservation also recognized collectors as a positive asset towards that goal
EVENT : In it was a blurb reporting that the American Carousel Society had recently disbanded
EVENT : The mid to late 1990's saw the passing of NCA founder Fred Fried, and also that of Charlotte Dinger, both who represented the two opposite points of view in the carousel preservation debate

EVENT : The recent Iraq election was boycott by the Sunnis which constitute about 20% of the population
EVENT : If so, should that affect the legitimacy of the election
EVENT : A leading group of Iraqi Sunni clerics have said the country's landmark election lacks legitimacy as so many Sunnis did not take part in the vote
EVENT : The clerics had encouraged Sunnis to boycott the elections because of the presence of US and foreign troops
EVENT : The US and Iraqi authorities, as well as the United Nations, have hailed the election as a "victory for democracy
EVENT : But the Association of Muslim Scholars says any government elected in the poll will not reflect the people's will
EVENT : These elections lack legitimacy because a large segment of different sects, parties and currents with their influence in Iraq boycotted," the association said in a statement
EVENT : If the Sunni's were prevented, or restricted or otherwise not allowed to vote, then they could claim illegitimacy, but since the simply just collectively decided not to vote, then they declared the vote legitimate of their own volition whilest simultaneously ceding power to all non-Sunnis
EVENT : Were they consulted on setting the date of election and how to distribute seats from the votes gain
EVENT : In addition, they are restricted from moving freely in their own country and/or their own city, would that not restricted their election related activities
EVENT : The Sunni's now claim that the vote is not legitimate because they didn't vote
EVENT : It's not their right to decide the legitimacy of the vote
EVENT : If anyone has a right to call the elections "illegitimate" it would be the shi'ites
EVENT : A leading group of Iraqi Sunni clerics have said the country's landmark election lacks legitimacy as so many Sunnis did not take part in the vote
EVENT : Sunni say the poll is now illegitimate because they chose not to vote
EVENT : They faced, however, no pressure from the rest of the country, nor from the "occupying" forces to stay away from the vote
EVENT : You are talking about physically restricted to vote at election day
EVENT : If one slices off one's nose to spite their face, then nobody should be surprised about their complaints of bleeding
EVENT : America invasion, occupation Iraqis are unprovoked
EVENT : Who do you think the insurgents were killing -- shi'ites
EVENT : Again, America has LPDR under its control, and America can launch airstrikes and ground units from Laos
EVENT : Regardless of what happens, the U.S. has a direct ethnic connection to China by way of Hmong, which will secure CIA-insurgency operations
EVENT : Unlike the current situation in the Middle-East, where the number of Arabic-speaking CIA agents are few, there will be plenty of Hmong/Chinese-speaking CIA agents for disposal and use in the looming Sino-US war
EVENT : Read between the lines, the war will not be between the US and North Korea
EVENT : With a precedant set in Iraq for preemptive attacks, Laos will be taken overnight and become a source of invaluable logistics for U.S. military attacks on China
EVENT : With a precedant set in Iraq for preemptive attacks, Laos will be taken overnight and become a source of invaluable logistics for U.S. military attacks on China
EVENT : If LPDR plays ball with Uncle Sam, then there will be no bloodshed in Laos
EVENT : Perhaps by route of Thailand, if LPDR does not cooperate, the US will incite insurrection in the southern provinces of China
EVENT : These provinces have a lot of Hmong people, and have been known to be the fiercest opposition to Chinese rule (aka Remember the Miao Rebellions
EVENT : This will be the Hmong's God-given chance to fight for their own country
EVENT : now, you are expert of preemptive strike...LOL
EVENT : and the hmong sits and watch from the sideline while KIM II and BUSH jr. kill each other...Now wouldn;t that be a scene to view
EVENT : With a precedant set in Iraq for preemptive attacks, Laos will be taken overnight and become a source of invaluable logistics for U.S. military attacks on China
EVENT : Some Hmong Americans may be reintroduced to Laos
EVENT : Saddam posed a threat to Saudia, Kuwait, and the British oil protectorates along the Gulf - that is why we invaded, stupid
EVENT : The truth seems to me that the Israeli government got panicked when Saddam announced that he would reward the families of Palestinian suicide bombers with some 10 thousand dollars
EVENT : Too young to remember the scuds Saddam's Iraqi Republican Guards lobbed into Israel in 1991, or 1982 when the Israelis levelled the Iraqi nuclear weapon facility
EVENT : Too young to remember the scuds Saddam's Iraqi Republican Guards lobbed into Israel in 1991, or 1982 when the Israelis levelled the Iraqi nuclear weapon facility
EVENT : Don't even bother asking if this guy remembers the Iraq/Iran war of 1980-1988, which when Saddam launched a land/ air invasion of Iran
EVENT : Recall that we (and the Brits) involved ourselves in that war ONLY in 1987, after attacks on Kuwaiti oil tankers
EVENT : How many Iraqis and Iranians were killed in that war
EVENT : Don't even bother asking if this guy remembers the Iraq/Iran war of 1980-1988, which when Saddam launched a land/ air invasion of Iran
EVENT : Anyone remember Khomeini's declaration in 1982 that Iran wouldn't stop fighting until they overthrew Saddam
EVENT : How about Saddam's use of chemical weapons
EVENT : Recall that we (and the Brits) involved ourselves in that war ONLY in 1987, after attacks on Kuwaiti oil tankers
EVENT : How many Iraqis and Iranians were killed in that war
EVENT : Saddam was so unimpressed by Iraqi casualties, he invaded Kuwait barely two years after the UN-imposed ceasefire
EVENT : With the deaths of many of the idealistic leaders who had led Japan's rise to international prominence, and the refusal of the US to intervene in Asian affairs, in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions from Germany, Britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly aggressive Japan in the area
EVENT : It was a war that Japan assumed would be ended in "3 to 6 months"; at the time of Pearl Harbor, it had been going on for 5 years, at the cost of over half a million Japanese lives
EVENT : To have these resources, she must seize them, if others refused to sell them
EVENT : In order to seize them, she felt she had to attack and destroy the naval power of the US
EVENT : she must seize them, if others refused to sell them
EVENT : In order to seize them, she felt she had to attack and destroy the naval power of the US
EVENT : I hear discussion along the lines that the United States was *wanting* to go to war with Japan, and had been trying to bring that about for years
EVENT : To make a very long story short, it is foolish to assume that the US wanted to go to war against Japan prior to 1941, considering the weight of evidence arguing against a US desire for war, and the overwhelming lack of evidence (not to mention rational thought) arguing for a US desire for war
EVENT : To make a very long story short, it is foolish to assume that the US wanted to go to war against Japan prior to 1941, considering the weight of evidence arguing against a US desire for war, and the overwhelming lack of evidence (not to mention rational thought) arguing for a US desire for war
EVENT : I've read quite a few more rational works describing how the US was doing its best to avoid, or at the very least postpone, a war against Japan, mainly because FDR was trying to provoke Hitler to war and didn't need a distraction on another distant front
EVENT : I've read quite a few more rational works describing how the US was doing its best to avoid, or at the very least postpone, a war against Japan, mainly because FDR was trying to provoke Hitler to war and didn't need a distraction on another distant front

EVENT : The thesis has been expounded by several conspiracy theorists, mainly the ones who expounded that FDR knew Pearl Harbor was about to be attacked, and let it happen
EVENT : The thesis has been expounded by several conspiracy theorists, mainly the ones who expounded that FDR knew Pearl Harbor was about to be attacked, and let it happen
EVENT : One of their "proofs" was that the US carriers were out of port during the attack, and "everybody knew" carriers were the capital ship of the future
EVENT : Wasn't Japan just defending herself when she attacked the US
EVENT : This line of reasoning seems to derive from arguments that Japan was being "driven into a corner" by sanctions, and had no choice but to attack the US
EVENT : However, the two carriers operating out of Pearl at the moment were sent West with light escort, on possibly intersecting routes with the IJN Kido Butai, which had far more carriers and a far heavier escort
EVENT : Consequently, for the PH conspiracy theorists to believe that FDR kept the carriers out of harm's way, we not only have to grant FDR the full knowledge of Kido Butai's route of approach would not result in either USN carrier fleet getting caught in a hopeless battle, but that FDR could psychically manipulate the weather to prevent Halsey from sailing into Pearl and thus be ambushed
EVENT : Consequently, for the PH conspiracy theorists to believe that FDR kept the carriers out of harm's way, we not only have to grant FDR the full knowledge of Kido Butai's route of approach would not result in either USN carrier fleet getting caught in a hopeless battle, but that FDR could psychically manipulate the weather to prevent Halsey from sailing into Pearl and thus be ambushed

EVENT : However, after World War I, Japan failed to recognize a fundamental shift in the attitudes of her former Imperial partners; they began a long, slow process of disengaging themselves from their former Imperial areas, from their colonies, in addition to outright stopping all expansions
EVENT : With the deaths of many of the idealistic leaders who had led Japan's rise to international prominence, and the refusal of the US to intervene in Asian affairs, in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions from Germany, Britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly aggressive Japan in the area
EVENT : With the deaths of many of the idealistic leaders who had led Japan's rise to international prominence, and the refusal of the US to intervene in Asian affairs, in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions from Germany, Britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly aggressive Japan in the area
EVENT : This drain was greatly accelerated by Japan's invasion of China proper in 1936
EVENT : It was a war that Japan assumed would be ended in "3 to 6 months"; at the time of Pearl Harbor, it had been going on for 5 years, at the cost of over half a million Japanese lives
EVENT : The war put a tremendous strain on Japan (and was in fact opposed by more radically NATIONALISTIC elements, as taking away from the development of Japan's other possessions, particularly in the areas of scrap metal and fuel
EVENT : Domestic consumption fell, consumer goods became scarce, and the use of materiale for war purposes ate into Japan's domestic industry
EVENT : This cut further into her foreign reserves, exacerbating the economic impact of the war
EVENT : The war effort took on a life of its own, however, and common sense was subordinated to it
EVENT : While Japanese officials realized that they had enough of each resource for Japan to do well IF THE WAR IN CHINA STOPPED, they were powerless over the military they were supposed to control
EVENT : For no reason anyone could articulate, Japan felt she had to continue the war in China
EVENT : To continue the war in China, she had to have resources of oil and metal
EVENT : Japan expanded into areas of China and Indochina which had no strategic value to her, but put her in a position to threaten British and Dutch possessions in the area; possessions that both those Allied nations needed in order to continue their fight against Hitler
EVENT : An abortive attack on Soviet positions in Mongolia had placed Japan's focus firmly south, towards the possessions of the US' future allies
EVENT : Thus, for a "3 to 6 month" operation in China in 1937, Japan would embark on a war that would strip her of all the possessions and industries she had acquired in 70 years

EVENT : confirmation of the electoral arithmetic: the states where Lincoln got an abolute majority of the popular vote (i.e., all the free states except Oregon, California, and New Jersey) were sufficient to bring him a majority in the Electoral College
EVENT : The reason that Lincoln could get an electoral majority with only forty percent of the popular vote was not that his opposition was divided but that he had far fewer "wasted" votes than his opponents--in ten southern states he got no popular votes at all
EVENT : This would have delayed secession and the Civil War
EVENT : Whether it was Lincoln vs. Douglas or Lincoln vs. Fusion Candidate, wouldn't a candidate having won the Electoral College vote with only 40% of the popular vote have provoked protests anyhow
EVENT : Lincoln won a plurality with about 40% of the vote

EVENT : You wouldn't know anything about the slaughter of gays if you only listened to the BBC
EVENT : I have just (in the last 1/2 hour) heard Radio Wales refer to the millions of Jews and other minorites including Gypsies and homosexuals who died in the concentration camps
EVENT : As mentioned in "The Final Solution" thread, the number of men killed for being homosexual was at the most 10-15,000
EVENT : The murder of (at the most) 10k homosexuals wasn't
EVENT : Now that's significant, but compared to the genocide of Jews and Zigeuner it's not as significant (though of course to the family and loved ones of those who died every single one is significant
EVENT : This is a bit like rating Stalin and Hitler for badness purely on the grounds of the number of deaths they were responsible for
EVENT : It's "significant" if any group of people is identified for liquidation by the government of the country in which they live, surely
EVENT : I did get an email back from the BBC saying that they understood what I was saying and would try to be more inclusive
EVENT : The Holocaust of the Jews and Zigeuner was motivated by racial prejudices
EVENT : The Jews and Zigeuner on the other hand were killed simply for their ontological state
EVENT : Now that's significant, but compared to the genocide of Jews and Zigeuner it's not as significant (though of course to the family and loved ones of those who died every single one is significant
EVENT : Most homosexuals arrested during the Nazi era were imprisoned in normal jails
EVENT : Once again, I'm not diminishing the horror of any individual murder, just trying to get it into perspective
EVENT : I think the chance of their being only 10000 who were homosexual amongst the how ever million were killed in the camps is rather small
EVENT : Records appear to show that 50000 _men_ were convicted of homosexuality during the Nazi rule, finding out how many were sent to a camp and killed there is more difficult especially as some who were sent to normal jails were transferred to camps at the end of their sentence, but 10-15k seems reasonable

EVENT : Yet again I notice that the media see gays as 'invisible' when it comes to Holocaust Day
EVENT : I was watching the BBC news this morning and they interviewed the man who is going to be in charge of Holocaust Day, certainly in the future
EVENT : Most homosexuals arrested during the Nazi era were imprisoned in normal jails

NEVENT : I've got too many friends in Iraq right now I want to see come home alive and well, and I will support them at every opportunity
NEVENT : I didn't mean to wait this long and never intended to ignore the issue, but I have been extremely busy last week with Thanksgiving and everything that goes along with it
NEVENT : This is problem that needs to be addressed
NEVENT : As this article points out, the SKS wasn't included on the list of banned weapons as part of the 10-year ban on certain assault weapons signed by President Clinton
NEVENT : The SKS is a medium-powered carbine equipped with a 10-round magazine, just like the pistol I'm displaying in the photo on the left hand side of this blog
NEVENT : Banned weapons had capacities of more than 10 rounds; so like my small 9mm, the SKS was not classified as an assault weapon
NEVENT : So let's not center our discussion around the gun, let's talk about the person behind the trigger
NEVENT : Well, we'll debate that later on in the show
NEVENT : We'll have a couple of experts come out, so I'll withhold my comments until then
NEVENT : Now, why has our president placed homeland security in the hands of Republican political hacks instead of professionals, by the way?
NEVENT : Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example, is a career politician
NEVENT : Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge is another career politician who was passed over by Mr. Bush for the vice presidency
NEVENT : And Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Asa Hutchinson is yet another career politician and a graduate of the disgraceful Bob Jones University
NEVENT : Apparently, Mr. Bush only turns to professionals when it's really important, like political consulting
NEVENT : And you know what, they did a hell of a job for our country
NEVENT : Our president has put homeland security in the hands of failed Republican hacks
NEVENT : So it's OK -- it's OK to have professional politicians at the Justice
NEVENT : Department and the Pentagon...
NEVENT : Janet Reno was a career prosecutor
NEVENT : ust a minute, let me finish my sentence, please
NEVENT : No, the difference is Janet Reno was a career prosecutor
NEVENT : John Ashcroft wasn't half the woman that Janet Reno was
NEVENT : Another potential Democratic presidential candidate pondered whether to run, and he made his announcement, and surprise, surprise, the answer was no
NEVENT : Why not? Surely Chris Dodd is at least more credible than Carol Moseley-Braun or Dennis Kucinich
NEVENT : I guess that means harassing Tom Ridge, fighting tax cuts and obstructing President Bush's plans to reform judiciary. Some two years
NEVENT : God, I hope so
NEVENT : that's all I can say
NEVENT : I love Senator Dodd
NEVENT : He would have brought a lot to the race
NEVENT : He brings a lot to the Senate and to the debate
NEVENT : And I'm glad that he's going to be fighting those fights
NEVENT : Well, the Commerce Department reports today that consumer spending declined in January and that the manufacturing sector slowed in February
NEVENT : Meanwhile, the deficit now at $300 billion
NEVENT : Mr. Bush apparently is untroubled by this fiscal collapse
NEVENT : One of his aides tells the current issue of "TIME," magazine, quote, "even if it's $500 billion, so what?"
NEVENT : Of course, even a $500 billion deficit number doesn't count the $3 trillion Mr. Bush is robbing from the Social Security trust fund
NEVENT : You know, we should have known, every time George W. Bush gets in trouble, he borrows from a trust fund. It's been his whole life, you know
NEVENT : Let me give you two economic facts of like, which you should know, even if you won't recognize them
NEVENT : Number one, there is absolutely no relationship between the deficit and unemployment
NEVENT : They don't go together
NEVENT : And number two, there is no Social Security fund, Virginia
NEVENT : There just isn't one
NEVENT : Because Bush squandered it on his tax cuts
NEVENT : There never has been one
NEVENT : There has been one for 60 years
NEVENT : Welcome back
NEVENT : Bob, one of the reasons I think so many Americans are worried about this war and so many people around the world don't want to go is there have been a lot of problems with credibility from this administration
NEVENT : Bad move
NEVENT : But while he was here, he gave us a whole lot of information
NEVENT : Gave us a whole lot of information
NEVENT : Well, our president told us that information proves that the dictator had chemical weapons, which is true
NEVENT : But what we just learned this week from Newsweek magazine which got a hold of the debriefings, is that he also told us it was destroyed back in 1995
NEVENT : Why hasn't our president told us that? Why do we have to learn it from Newsweek
NEVENT : I don't believe that he believed it was all destroyed
NEVENT : Good point
NEVENT : But shouldn't our president have told us what the CIA told him
NEVENT : Why do we learn from Newsweek
NEVENT : Should he level with us
NEVENT : Bush isn't sitting in that White House not thinking about the body bags coming home with great young men
NEVENT : I was at the medal of honor ceremony for the kids
NEVENT : I am shook over the aftermath
NEVENT : But, this guy is a monster, a mini-me Hitler
NEVENT : Take a look at it
NEVENT : That's pretty good support isn't it
NEVENT : Now, Bob, come on you don't really buy this
NEVENT : I mean, listen, this is the oldest trick in the book
NEVENT : You can have a general question like this that could mean anything and ask people and they give you what comes off the top of their head
NEVENT : But, ask them another question, ask them what they think about spending $1.3 trillion in destroying this economy
NEVENT : Ask them how they feel about getting bogged down
NEVENT : Well, I've seen some of the figures
NEVENT : Once you start telling Americans the story, -- the administration refuse today tell us story
NEVENT : Tom, you know what liberals want
NEVENT : They don't want a smoking gun, they want a smoking city
NEVENT : The Clinton people all say
NEVENT : Former Congressman, Bob Dornan from California
NEVENT : You're not going to get a smoking city
NEVENT : Time for Fireback, when the viewers fire back at us
NEVENT : Joshua Hosford of Newport Beach, California -- that would be nice in this weathers -- Paul, I guess we're going after all
NEVENT : Case in point, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed
NEVENT : It's amazing how someone can actually do two things at once
NEVENT : Joshua, you couldn't have said anything better
NEVENT : In fact, I've already said it
NEVENT : Well, in fact, our allies got Mr. Mohammed along with us
NEVENT : We need allies
NEVENT : And Bush is so far angered every ally we have
NEVENT : Bush has been torturing Americans for two years. Why should this guy get preferential treatment
NEVENT : And I thought he was -- I thought he was busy running the Redskins
NEVENT : No? OK
NEVENT : The next comment is from Frank Mastro of New York City
NEVENT : Mr.Novak, I don't understand the problem
NEVENT : I say that to all the rich millionaire Democrats, like Carville and Begala, who don't want tax cuts
NEVENT : Pay it anyway
NEVENT : They'll defeat Bush and everybody will get rich
NEVENT : That's a better strategy
NEVENT : David Horn of Long Island, New York, writes, "How can Bush say he's for democracy
NEVENT : Where did he learn to govern, 1930's Chicago
NEVENT : Hi
NEVENT : I'm Paul Avalar (ph) from Tempe, Arizona
NEVENT : I had a question also about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed
NEVENT : That's a great question
NEVENT : It's an unanswerable point
NEVENT : He hasn't been able to answer it
NEVENT : And Tom Andrews (ph) wasn't able to answer it
NEVENT : Look, we need allies to catch these guys
NEVENT : We got him because the Pakistanis got him
NEVENT : We didn't get him
NEVENT : We go to war in Iraq, 200,000 people start protesting in Pakistan, they put too much pressure on the government
NEVENT : It becomes impossible for those governments to cooperate with us like they're cooperating now
NEVENT : We go to war in Iraq, it would be the worst thing we can do
NEVENT : You know the one thing the Democrats can't stand is good news
NEVENT : It is just something you cannot handle
NEVENT : No
NEVENT : What I can't stand is a president who is going to screw up our war against terrorism when I thought that was his job
NEVENT : From the left, I'm Paul Begala
NEVENT : Good night for CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : From the right, I'm Robert Novak
NEVENT : Join us again next time for another edition of CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : Welcome back to CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : Ironically down in North Carolina today was also the day funeral services were held for 17-year-old Jesica Santillan, the brave young woman who got the wrong heart and lungs in a botched transplant operation last month
NEVENT : Is her family's pain and suffering only worth $250,000
NEVENT : Ralph Nader, there are states in crisis that keep adding to the list by the AMA where doctors are going out of business because they can't afford the medical malpractice rates
NEVENT : We'll just run a scroll of some of the states
NEVENT : They're big states. Florida, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Texas
NEVENT : This is a real crisis that lawyers have perpetrated on America, isn't it
NEVENT : Another one of your leading questions
NEVENT : This is a medical malpractice crisis
NEVENT : And the insurance companies which had relatively steady rates on doctors for about 10 years have found its investment income, its interest income, the stock market collapse down
NEVENT : And so they're jacking up the rates on a few key specialties like obstetricians and neurosurgeons
NEVENT : But if you take the entire amount of premiums, Bob, that's paid by doctrs in this country to malpractice insurers and divide it evenly, they'd be paying less than $9,000 each
NEVENT : That's one-third of what they pay a receptionist
NEVENT : You know, Ralph, you and I often agree on some things and one thing I think we agree on is the dirty effect of money and politics
NEVENT : This is first and foremost, Bob, a question of equity
NEVENT : The Congress is going to handcuff the judges and juries in the United States at the state court level
NEVENT : I haven't yet met one senator or representative who's for this bill who has demonstrated that the jurors in their home state and the judges in their home state are incompetent, unwilling or unable to perform justice in these medical malpractice cases
NEVENT : And I've never heard one person say that the insurance executives who make $250,000 a week, every week without any pain and suffering, no one is saying cap those
NEVENT : Dr. Palmisano, first thank you for being here
NEVENT : Thank you
NEVENT : Pleasure to be here
NEVENT : And, I want to ask you to respond to one of the witnesses, John McCormick testified today
NEVENT : He said that the hospital ignored abnormal CO2 levels in her blood
NEVENT : Said that the attending physician had slept through several pages
NEVENT : Listen to what Mr. McCormick said and I'll ask you to respond
NEVENT : Mr. President, from father to father, my family's pain and suffering are not frivolous
NEVENT : Isn't he right
NEVENT : Isn't our president wrong to be -- did he win the Lottery
NEVENT : You know, Mr. Bush -- President Bush says these guys have won the litigation Lottery
NEVENT : Well, the current medical liability system is affecting patients in that they can't get access to care
NEVENT : The American Medical Association works very hard to make safety a priority in the medical care system
NEVENT : The current system doesn't measure negligence
NEVENT : It measures disability
NEVENT : Another witness today told of what happened to her husband because there were no longer neurosurgeons available in the community
NEVENT : Those are important points, I don't doubt
NEVENT : Yes
NEVENT : Well, what has to be done here is balance
NEVENT : What we need is a system that's fair to everyone, a system that keeps the physicians in practice and allows patients to have access to physicians in their hour of need.
NEVENT : And the system in California that's in the bill, in Congress now, HR-5, that's a system that has worked
NEVENT : Because in California they have regulated the insurance company premium levels
NEVENT : And in Florida, they've been very weak on it
NEVENT : In other words a small percentage of doctors that are bad, incompetent, indifferent, whatever
NEVENT : They're not performing properly and the AMA is not cracking down, is not supporting expansion to state licensing
NEVENT : I want to respond to that
NEVENT : The National Practitioner Data Bank is the source of the information and it was brought up today
NEVENT : First of all, the Government Accounting Office criticized the methodology used
NEVENT : It doesn't mention whether they are obstetricians, neurosurgeons or emergency medicine
NEVENT : It doesn't list that
NEVENT : Now are these bad doctors? We'll have no doctors, we'll have no neurosurgeons, no obstetricians
NEVENT : We've got to take a break
NEVENT : Maybe they are bad doctors
NEVENT : Welcome back
NEVENT : Both the AMA and the Bush administration released reports this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of their practices all across the country
NEVENT : President Bush points this way today, even the most frivolous of lawsuits cost money, premiums go up and either way, the patient pays
NEVENT : We're debating malpractice reform with consumer advocate Ralph Nader, and AMA President-Elect Dr. Ronald Palmisano
NEVENT : Dr Palmisano, again, thanks for staying with us through the break
NEVENT : He was the governor of my state of Texas, where there are a whole lot of doctors
NEVENT : It turns out that he didn't do any ind of a job policing your profession at all when he was the governor of Texas
NEVENT : It has forgiven physicians who overlook cancerous tumors, who maimed infants or whose mistakes left women sterilized
NEVENT : Thousands more may have been ignored over the last decade
NEVENT : That is the Bush record in policing surgeons, why should we trust him now
NEVENT : Well, first off
NEVENT : Physicians generally, not just surgeons, forgive me
NEVENT : Sure
NEVENT : What we need to do is to make sure that state boards, number one, have adequate funding
NEVENT : The AMA supports that
NEVENT : But it's also
NEVENT : Well, it's also unfair to make a judgment without knowing all of the facts of the case
NEVENT : Troy Brennan (ph) of Harvard said there's no correlation with negligence, only with disability
NEVENT : So let's look at all of the facts, but give everybody due process here in America before we criticize
NEVENT : Even file a claim
NEVENT : And the entire pay-out to all of the victims that get a little money, not the 90 percent who never file a claim, amounts to less than what we spend on dog food
NEVENT : On dog food
NEVENT : It's about $5.4 billion is the pay-out
NEVENT : That's a fraction of physician income
NEVENT : It's a fraction of the health care expense of 1.4 trillion
NEVENT : What we have to do is look at all the facts and have balance here
NEVENT : That's what the people in Congress have to do
NEVENT : They have to make sure that whatever they decide keeps doctors in practice and patients having access to care
NEVENT : Doctors are going
NEVENT : They don't abandon their patients, except for the high premiums of a few specialties
NEVENT : Because of the premiums
NEVENT : But first of all let me
NEVENT : Why don't you crack down on the insurance companies
NEVENT : No. Let's talk about the facts
NEVENT : Let's talk about the facts
NEVENT : That's the fact
NEVENT : I was just in Oklahoma, they own this insurance company
NEVENT : They are trying to do their very best
NEVENT : It's a company not for profit
NEVENT : What happens here is that more money is being paid out than comes in
NEVENT : And as far as the investment income, A.M
NEVENT : Bests (ph) show that in the past five years, the investment income has been stable at around 5 percent
NEVENT : Brown Brothers Harriman said that investments did not precipitate the current crisis
NEVENT : Why do you want that to be secret
NEVENT : All of the information about bad doctors in the National Practitioner bank, you, the AMA wants to keep it secret from other doctors and other patients around the country who want to know whether their doctor is on that list
NEVENT : Let's listen to what he said to the AMA today
NEVENT : They should be able to recover non- economic damages as well
NEVENT : But for the sake of the system, non- economic damages should be capped at $250,000
NEVENT : What in the world is wrong with that
NEVENT : Tell me what's wrong with that
NEVENT : What's wrong
NEVENT : Tell someone who had a double mastectomy, tell an infant who's brain-damaged and has no economic loss that for the rest of their lives they're going to get dribbled out $250,000 for their entire life expectancy
NEVENT : Wait a minute
NEVENT : The head of AIG a few years ago was making $250,000 every week
NEVENT : Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money, though
NEVENT : Not for you, but for most people it's a lot of money
NEVENT : These executives, why don't you tell
NEVENT : In California - wait, Mr. Nader. In California
NEVENT : Why don't you cap insurance
NEVENT : Mr. Palmisano, go ahead
NEVENT : Give me a moment, please
NEVENT : Go ahead, go ahead
NEVENT : In California where they have this law, it caps the non-economics, the ones you can't quantify
NEVENT : So all medicals, all rehabilitation, care services in the home, lost wages
NEVENT : No, no, no
NEVENT : I've got to ask Mr. Nader, we are almost out of time
NEVENT : Doug Friedman (ph), who ran Jesse Ventura's campaign for governor four years ago, says he wants you to run for president again
NEVENT : I know you're saying it's much too early to run for president
NEVENT : But one simple question, Ralph, will you consider another run for president
NEVENT : Much too early to consider
NEVENT : I am concerned about Donald Zook (ph), who's head of a medical malpractice insurance company, a big one in the West, saying that his insurance company executive colleagues should not blame the tort injury system
NEVENT : He said that your problem of jacking up these insurance rates is self-inflicted
NEVENT : Here's an insurance company executive who is saying that
NEVENT : Well, Mr. Zook is one executive you are quoting
NEVENT : What we need to do is look at all of the people who don't have doctors
NEVENT : Hey, let's get some agreement
NEVENT : Should we get some agreement
NEVENT : What?
NEVENT : Do you want to really crack down on the bad doctors
NEVENT : We want to crack down on the attorneys who file frivolous suits
NEVENT : Fine. Fine
NEVENT : What kind of peer review is that?
NEVENT : Wait. Wait
NEVENT : Do you want to crack down on the bad doctors?
NEVENT : You're in AMA
NEVENT : We definitely want to crack down on bad doctors
NEVENT : Do you want to control insurance rates?
NEVENT : We want the free market to dictate what is done
NEVENT : The free market actually dictates we have got to sell some commercials here on CNN or we're all out of
NEVENT : Thanks. Privilege to be here
NEVENT : Welcome back to CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : Over in Iraq, arms inspectors are discovering and destroying missiles
NEVENT : Spy planes are searching for more banned arms, and Iraqi scientists are being interviewed by U.N. weapons inspectors
NEVENT : Back with us to talk about it, two Congressmen: J.D
NEVENT : Hayworth, the Republican from Arizona, and Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont
NEVENT : But I want to ask you a question
NEVENT : The answer is, these are my neighbors from Vermont and obviously we're going to support them
NEVENT : But let's be clear
NEVENT : The president almost unilaterally is putting us in this position against world opinion
NEVENT : Didn't the Congress support it?
NEVENT : I thought you voted for it
NEVENT : I did not vote for it
NEVENT : I mean the Congress
NEVENT : The majority rules
NEVENT : Yes. The Congress gave him authority, but the American people disagreed with the decision
NEVENT : Not according to the polls
NEVENT : Not the polls that I have seen
NEVENT : Congressman Hayworth, back to a comment
NEVENT : And I know that you meant it and I agreed with it
NEVENT : This is Saddam Hussein, the butcher of Baghdad
NEVENT : I'm curious, would that have accurately described him in 1988
NEVENT : Oh, yes. I think it does
NEVENT : I think it has described him, especially since he's taken basically a one-man rule over with the Baath Party in 1979
NEVENT : I agree
NEVENT : Therefore, wasn't Dick Cheney, as the CEO of Halliburton, wrong to be selling oilfield equipment to the butcher of Baghdad in 1988
NEVENT : I don't know about any oil equipment going to Saddam Hussein
NEVENT : What I do know in the here and now is
NEVENT : I can tell you about it if you like
NEVENT : That's fine
NEVENT : And I know you'd love to cloud the issue
NEVENT : That's an important issue to me
NEVENT : Dissent is fine, but these cheap shots, I don't know anything about Halliburton.
NEVENT : He had $73 million worth of (UNINTELLIGIBLE) to sell oilfield equipment to Saddam Hussei
NEVENT : And to somehow try to play partisan parlor games may be cute, but we are dealing with a clear and present danger
NEVENT : Would you have treated him as a customer, the way Dick Cheney did?
NEVENT : I don't even know about that
NEVENT : Would you have sold oilfield equipment to him?
NEVENT : Yes. Hello? Iran had hostages
NEVENT : Seventy-nine Americans were held hostage
NEVENT : Hello? Hello? We're talking
NEVENT : The United States of America
NEVENT : Oh the evil United States
NEVENT : But the point is
NEVENT : I want to get to that point
NEVENT : I can't quite figure that out
NEVENT : Everybody knows that
NEVENT : The CIA did that
NEVENT : No, the point I made, Khomeini came about because we put a brutal dictator, the Shah of Iran, in power
NEVENT : The point that I am making is you cannot
NEVENT : The point you're making is blame America first\
NEVENT : No I'm not
NEVENT : That's what you're doing
NEVENT : You're talking about blowback
NEVENT : We know what happens
NEVENT : Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, thank you very much
NEVENT : Congressman J.D. Hayworth, a Republican from Arizona, thank you both very much
NEVENT : We will come back to this debate, believe me
NEVENT : One of our viewers, though, thinks there's a sure fire way to get that al Qaeda ring leader to talk
NEVENT : We'll let him fire back in a little bit
NEVENT : But next, out of all of the pictures from this weekend's nail biter between J.D. Hayworth's alma mater of state, and
NEVENT : Bob Novak's beloved University of Maryland, only one photo is dramatic enough or politically charged enough to be the CROSSFIRE Picture of the Day
NEVENT : You do not want to miss this
NEVENT : Hi. I'm Christa Demore (ph) from Monrovia, Maryland
NEVENT : And it also proves you can even chew gum and walk at the same time
NEVENT : Doesn't it show that?
NEVENT : He cannot eat a pretzel and watch a football became at the same time
NEVENT : So I'm still doubtful of -- no, here's why
NEVENT : This is a serious point and you deserve a serious answer
NEVENT : We now have a foreign policy in Iraq that is putting enormous strain on those allies
NEVENT : We're not severing it -- question
NEVENT : Hi. I'm Ben Charlton (ph) from East Lansing, Michigan
NEVENT : I was -- if we wait for U.N. approval for action in Iraq, don't we sacrifice some of our national sovereignty
NEVENT : Well, where are all of the conservative questions
NEVENT : We never have conservatives in the audience
NEVENT : There's no question
NEVENT : I think even Paul would agree with me
NEVENT : It's not a United Nations question
NEVENT : That is correct
NEVENT : The president has got all of the legal authorities he needs
NEVENT : I just pray to god he doesn't use it
NEVENT : We need to go to the U.N. because we want to build coalitions so we have support around the world and so that we don't have to carry the burden ourselves
NEVENT : But legally he has no obligation to go back to the U.N
NEVENT : From the left I am Paul Begala
NEVENT : Goodnight for CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : From the right, I'm Robert Novak
NEVENT : Join us next time for another edition of CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : Hello, everybody
NEVENT : Welcome to CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : We will debate all of that as well as Vanity Fair's latest, stunning revelations about Michael Jackson
NEVENT : Believe it or not, we got new news on Michael Jackson
NEVENT : Do you think he really looks like a mummy? Certainly not a daddy
NEVENT : But first, our own little moonwalk across the political landscape, the CROSSFIRE Political Alert
NEVENT : The foreign ministers of France, Germany and Russia today issued a joint declaration that they will not allow a second American-backed resolution to pass the United Nations Security Council
NEVENT : President Bush is said to be focusing on one fence-sitting Security Council member, the African nation of Guinea, because he said -- quote -- I used to have one of their pigs
NEVENT : So -- OK, I made that up
NEVENT : He didn't say that
NEVENT : Well, I suspected that
NEVENT : You know
NEVENT : But they are a swing vote
NEVENT : Guinea is an important swing vote
NEVENT : As is Cameroon
NEVENT : France and Germany are pointing to inspection and saying, Look, they're working
NEVENT : I think that's a good point
NEVENT : Well, France and Germany would like to
NEVENT : Powell called Iraqi steps toward disarmament -- quote -- too little, too late gestures, meant to split international resolve to force Baghdad to give up its weapons of mass destruction
NEVENT : U.S
NEVENT : intelligence said Powell indicates Iraq has hidden equipment to produce al-Samoud 2 missiles, even as it destroys existing ones, missiles that until recently, it claimed not to have
NEVENT : Powell also revealed that Iraq is hiding chemical and biological weapons in poor neighborhoods around Baghdad
NEVENT : In order to secure peace, Powell concluded, the international community must confront Saddam Hussein's refusal to disarm -- quote -- here and now
NEVENT : So, there you have it
NEVENT : who do you believe
NEVENT : Secretary of State Colin Powell or France
NEVENT : No, the question is
NEVENT : That is the question
NEVENT : Who do you believe: the Bush administration or your lying eyes
NEVENT : We are watching them destroy weapons, as the president says, Oh, that's just a hoax
NEVENT : But Paul
NEVENT : They are disarming
NEVENT : No, no, no that's not what the president's saying
NEVENT : He's saying, the -- it's a hoax to the extent that those are only a small number of the weapons there
NEVENT : Keep in mind, these are weapons that Saddam Hussein, until recently, said he didn't even have
NEVENT : He's a liar
NEVENT : Of course
NEVENT : And to trust Saddam Hussein in effort to disarm him -- foolish task,don't you think
NEVENT : Absolutely. Nobody trusts Saddam Hussein.
NEVENT : The question is, Is he a sufficient threat to America today to risk the lives of our young men and women
NEVENT : That's a separate question
NEVENT : That's a very separate question
NEVENT : I think he's not
NEVENT : I think the inspections can work
NEVENT : That's a different argument
NEVENT : We can take it up later
NEVENT : So there it is, according to NBC
NEVENT : In fact, the only liberal with the solo cable talk show
NEVENT : NBC, of course, is a division of the conglomerate GE, where they apparently only bring right wing things to life
NEVENT : I actually like Phil Donahue
NEVENT : I've interviewed him a number of times
NEVENT : His arguments are really dumb
NEVENT : I don't know if you've listened to Phil Donahue
NEVENT : Delightful guy, but his arguments don't make a lot of sense and I think that is the problem with liberal talk show hosts -- you excluded, of course, and James
NEVENT : But the arguments, actually, don't hold up very well
NEVENT : Have you noticed that
NEVENT : He had the highest-rated show on the network
NEVENT : Which is saying what
NEVENT : They're good to me
NEVENT : They're very nice people and they're very good to me
NEVENT : OK, OK, I'm not beat up on MSNBC
NEVENT : Early reviews have not been good, so yesterday she announced she'll be making some changes
NEVENT : Not to her ideas, which are few
NEVENT : Not to her record, which is pretty embarrassing
NEVENT : Not even to her staff, which is, of course, tiny
NEVENT : But to her name
NEVENT : From here on out, Carol Moseley-Braun as Carol Moseley Braun
NEVENT : Did you catch the difference? In the second version, there is no hyphen between her last names
NEVENT : Moseley Braun expects that primary voters in Iowa and New Hampshire will react enthusiastically to this radical, grammatical transformation
NEVENT : They'll have to, because the latest CNN poll shows Moseley Braun far behind the candidate she set out to discredit
NEVENT : That would be, of course, the honorable Al Sharpton
NEVENT : Sharpton is not only by far the first choice of black voters nationally, he is tied with Senator John Edwards among all voters and beating Governor Howard Dean, Representative Dennis Kucinich and Senator Bob Graham
NEVENT : Beating them
NEVENT : And Al Sharpton didn't even have to change his name
NEVENT : How did he become honorable?
NEVENT : Yes!
NEVENT : By embodying the values of your party
NEVENT : Your values, not mine
NEVENT : He's the No. 1 pick, the most popular, among all candidates, among black primary voters
NEVENT : I mean, you can't dismiss him. He's a serious candidate
NEVENT : We haven't even begun the primaries
NEVENT : He's not a serious candidate
NEVENT : He's right wing fantasy and it's never going to happen
NEVENT : Not right wing
NEVENT : Take Al Sharpton seriously, that's our message tonight
NEVENT : Then, can you spell prosthetic nose
NEVENT : Maureen Orth can, and she does in a new Vanity Fair profile of Michael Jackson
NEVENT : We'll talk to her
NEVENT : You won't want to miss that
NEVENT : We'll be right back
NEVENT : Welcome back to CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : France, Russia and Germany today restated their opposition to any new U.N. Security Council that could threaten Saddam Hussein's grip on power
NEVENT : Secretary of State Colin Powell goes to the U.N. tomorrow to do what he can
NEVENT : Mr.King, thanks for stying with us through the break
NEVENT : And you're a congressman who has put his constituents and his country ahead of his partisan interests
NEVENT : So I wonder if you'll join Charlie Rangel, who put out a press release today, decrying the Republican attempt to hijack a bill to help our servicemen to use it to give special interest tax breaks to corporations
NEVENT : The important thing is that the bill pass for the military
NEVENT : If the other stuff's in there, it's there
NEVENT : I mean to me, the main purpose should be the military
