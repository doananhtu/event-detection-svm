EVENT : After they hoisted the soldier in the truck, the two Iraqis -- one an officer, the other an NCO -- ran back to the facility and began treating the other wounded without regard for their safety
EVENT : After they hoisted the soldier in the truck, the two Iraqis -- one an officer, the other an NCO -- ran back to the facility and began treating the other wounded without regard for their safety
EVENT : When the dust settled and the mess tent had been evacuated, everybody who could talk was questioned about their health
EVENT : When the medics came to the two Iraqis, the ING soldiers only wanted to know how everybody else was
EVENT : No matter what the MSM tries to tell you, there are Iraqi's who will help the allies, who will fight alongside them and put their lives at risk to make sure Democracy succeeds in their country
EVENT : This brings to mind a speech Prime Minister Tony Blair gave recently while visiting Iraq
EVENT : There are people dying in Iraq, but the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying to make this country better
EVENT : There are people dying in Iraq, but the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying to make this country better
EVENT : There are people dying in Iraq, but the reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and the intimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone trying to make this country better
EVENT : And those people from that electoral commission that I described as the heroes of the new Iraq--every day . . . a lot of them aren't living in the Green Zone, they've got to travel in from outside
EVENT : They do not know at any point in time whether they're going to be subject to brutality or intimidation, even death, and yet they carry on doing it

EVENT : The FBI is looking into two incidents in Colorado Springs, Colo., and one each in Cleveland, Washington, Houston, Teterboro, N.J., and Medford, Ore., according to federal and local law enforcement and transportation officials, some of whom spoke only on condition of anonymity
EVENT : A federal law enforcement official, who declined to be identified by name, said Thursday there is no evidence of a plot or terrorist activity
EVENT : But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons
EVENT : Laser beams can temporarily blind or disorient pilots and possibly cause a plane to crash
EVENT : The Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo--which launched the infamous Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995--was discovered to have experimented with the use of lasers as weapons
EVENT : But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlier this month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use the devices as weapons
EVENT : Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training, altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat, and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks
EVENT : However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports
EVENT : That's not the sort of thing you pick up at a military surplus store
EVENT : It sounds like an organized effort to cause airline accidents," Thompson said
EVENT : Michelle Malkin has a post about this today where some outlets have stopped selling lasers
EVENT : A more frightening scenario is that terrorists may have obtained a Chinese-produced ZM-87 laser blinder which is specifically designed to blind eyesight
EVENT : Cult members apparently obtained laser design information from Russian institutes they visited and built a laser weapon mounted on a truck
EVENT : They had planned to use the laser against Tokyo policemen, but the plan failed when the laser malfunctioned during the testing stage
EVENT : I found the following report that was presented to Congress recently about the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners, which this might very well be a precursor to: Recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), referred to as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), pose to commercial airliners
EVENT : However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports
EVENT : While this legislation is still under consideration, Homeland Security appropriations designated $60 million in FY2004 and $61 million in FY2005 to fund a program to develop and test prototype missile countermeasure systems for commercial aircraft based on existing military technology
EVENT : The FBI, concerned that terrorists could use lasers as weapons, is investigating why laser beams were directed into the cockpits of seven airplanes in flight since Christmas
EVENT : One is the death of Yasser Arafat
EVENT : But since Arafat's death, Europeans and Americans have been able to find common ground: supporting Ariel Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza, putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections and, covertly, backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinian leader
EVENT : But since Arafat's death, Europeans and Americans have been able to find common ground: supporting Ariel Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza, putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections and, covertly, backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinian leader
EVENT : A second reason is Europe's growing worries about Islamic terrorism
EVENT : The murder in November of Theo van Gogh, a provocative Dutch filmmaker, at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called Europe's 9/11
EVENT : The Ukrainian election --- complete with its KGB-style poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy-handed electoral fraud -- has reminded European diplomats of Vladimir V. Putin's determination to control his "near abroad
EVENT : The Ukrainian election --- complete with its KGB-style poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy-handed electoral fraud -- has reminded European diplomats of Vladimir V. Putin's determination to control his "near abroad

EVENT : In a monstrous conflict of interest for a supposed straight news reporter, Fasulo acknowledges Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation and Better World Campaign for "their generous financial support" of her book project
EVENT : She also thanks the Rockefeller Brothers Fund "for helping to fund the project
EVENT : It seems a supposed straight shooting reporter with NBC was taking money to fund a book that is so pro-united nations that its almost sickening to read
EVENT : Its U.N. reporter has been on the payroll of the U.N. lobby
EVENT : Actually, the pro-U.N. lobby paid for it
EVENT : Why would an NBC reporter (who also reports on the U.N. for National Public Radio) take money from the U.N. lobby
EVENT : Linda Fasulo, the U.N. correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC, has written a pro-U.N. book, An Insider's Guide to the U.N. , which reads like the U.N. paid for it
EVENT : Perhaps because longtime NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw put his stamp of approval on the UNA-USA and BCUN by acting as master of ceremonies at their 2001 Global Leadership Dinner
EVENT : Another endorsement of the book comes from Barbara Crossette, former New York Times bureau chief at the U.N. who now writes for U.N. Wire, a Ted Turner-funded online news service that covers the U.N
EVENT : In an April 30, 2001, Washington Times column, Nat Hentoff noted that the media have devoted "scant mention" to the "plain fact that it was Mr. Annan, when he was head of the United Nation's peacekeeping office, who could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and their sympathizers in Rwanda in 1994
EVENT : It's true, Hentoff said, that the U.N. issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged, to some extent, its role in the killings
EVENT : A fascinating part of the book is how Fasulo manages to gloss over Annan's role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda
EVENT : She admits, however, that, "The Rwanda massacres occurred while Annan was U.N. Undersecretary General for peacekeeping," and that "After he became SG [Secretary General], Annan commissioned a report to examine what had happened and suggest remedies
EVENT : The informant offered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be used in the genocide campaign
EVENT : It denied authorization for the mission and told him that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness over to the Rwandan government which was planning the genocide
EVENT : The result was that the information dried up and the genocide took place
EVENT : Yup, good ole Kofi told this poor guy to give the secret info over to the very government that was planning the genocide
EVENT : But for five and a half years, he noted, Annan "refused to accept any responsibility for the Rwandan holocaust until Mr. Gourevitch and others revealed that less than 5,000 U.N. troops could have stopped the killings if Mr. Annan had not closed his eyes
EVENT : She tries to blame the U.S. and other members of the Security Council for not sending enough troops to stop it
EVENT : Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to Kofi Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned
EVENT : The truth is that, as director of U.N. peacekeeping, Annan personally refused requests to authorize U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda to seize weapons and prevent genocide
EVENT : Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to Kofi Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned
EVENT : He asked for that approval but the answer came back in a now-infamous "genocide fax" from Annan's office
EVENT : The American rift with Syria deepened this week, with suspicions that Syria might have been behind the assassination of Lebanon's former prime minister in Beirut on Monday

EVENT : In the past two weeks, the officials said, France has rebuffed appeals by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the Israeli foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, to list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, which would prevent it from raising money in Europe through charity groups
EVENT : Israeli and American officials say that the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has told them that he, too, regards Hezbollah as a destructive force in the Middle East, one determined to undermine peace talks by supporting militant groups that attack Israelis

EVENT : A European diplomat said the issue of calling Hezbollah a terrorist organization was discussed in Brussels on Wednesday at a meeting of the Clearing House, a unit of the European Union that meets in confidential sessions to review terrorist activities in Europe
EVENT : They don't want to rock the boat now by attempting to starve out the mullahs' terror agent that conducts the proxy attacks against Israel that Iran cannot afford to do itself openly
EVENT : The United States has long called Hezbollah a terrorist organization, but the French, American and European officials said, have opposed doing so, and argue that making such a designation now would be unwise, given the new turbulence in Lebanon
EVENT : Romania voted in the last December, ousting the so-called socialist party PSD (Social-Democratic Party
EVENT : Local leaders did their jobs, but national leaders, pressuring TV stations to lie, associating with old communist ex-president Ion Iliescu, failed to win in big cities
EVENT : Mischie was right to criticize the national leaders, because PSD got a good share in the elections in his area
EVENT : Nicolae Mischie, authoritarian leader of a district organization of the main opposition party, has been jailed
EVENT : His paper was on a political personality of the 19th century and Mischie bought the house where his paper's subject lived
EVENT : PSD is building a strategy for the 4 years to come and they are going to elect a leader
EVENT : It is known that communist leaders die in office (as judges of the U.S. Supreme Court) and Ion Iliescu won't be different

EVENT : Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go stalk the lobby for the girls that are bringing me my Krystals
EVENT : It's now just one day until I hop in the car and head back in time to the loveliest village on the Plains...Auburn, Alabama
EVENT : Can someone tell me why one of my friends or family members hasn't smacked me because of it
EVENT : One thing that made me laugh is that she showed up at her indictment in a fur coat
EVENT : Ummm, am I the only one that learned anything from the Michael Irvin drug trial of the mid 90's
EVENT : It seems that in recent years, instead of doing the people's business, good ole Linda has spent her time stealing over 600 grand in Federal Education funds
EVENT : Schrenko is a scumbag and, although she won't get any actual jail time, I hope the fine she pleads to is at least as much as what she stole
EVENT : Schrenko stole 20 times what Martha Stewart did, and I bet she won't see the wrong side of a jail cell door, and that's sad
EVENT : You never EVER show up at court, especially facing indictment for stealing large sums of money, wearing a fucking FUR COAT
EVENT : Schrenko is a scumbag and, although she won't get any actual jail time, I hope the fine she pleads to is at least as much as what she stole

EVENT : This isn't a football game, and it's not two drunken cousins fighting at a family reunion
EVENT : I want to know where the Federal criminal charges against all parties involved are
EVENT : A year ago, the program was in disarray and the coach was one poorly executed plane trip away from being fired by an over-zealous and too empowered booster with a fat checkbook
EVENT : This despite several late hits to the head, low hits at his knees and ankles, and various other assaults outside the realm of good sportsmanship

EVENT : After many minutes lying motionless on the field, Ferguson was finally removed via stretcher, giving a thumbs up to the crowd on the way out
EVENT : Coming from the other direction, Jacksonville DB Donovin Darius unloaded chin high on Ferguson with a vicious clothesline
EVENT : This was not one of the staged stiff-armed clotheslines you see in professional wrestling broadcasts
EVENT : This was a vicious, arm cocked and swinging clothesline that literally could have torn Ferguson's head off of his body
EVENT : Paul Tagliabue must give word to all of his employees that actions like this will not be tolerated
EVENT : One sidenote here is that, despite their rabid fandom and the situation, not one thing was thrown at the offending player as he left the field
EVENT : This was the most vicious and blatantly dirty play I have seen in the NFL since Jim McMahon was body slammed to the ground in the mid 80's about five seconds after he had released a pass
EVENT : I don't care what anyone says about "you can't judge intent." Darius' intent was to dismember, injure or even kill Ferguson
EVENT : I don't care what anyone says about "you can't judge intent." Darius' intent was to dismember, injure or even kill Ferguson
EVENT : I don't care what anyone says about "you can't judge intent." Darius' intent was to dismember, injure or even kill Ferguson
EVENT : In this day and age of bigger, stronger and faster players, injuries are going to happen accidentally all of the time
EVENT : There is simply no room for the kind of play that resulted in Ferguson's injury
EVENT : If not, I fully expect the Packers and many other teams to handle this matter "on the field" with Darius being the target of similar attacks by tight ends and offensive lineman
EVENT : I plan to call her this morning and tell her the total, complete with my rental car for a week
EVENT : I'm taking cars to the shop for things that are not my fault
EVENT : I will return this piece of shit on Friday, only to rent another vehicle Monday morning while we take the wife's car to the shop to get her 1400 bucks worth of damage repaired
EVENT : A year ago, Tuberville was one reporter's abililty to find an out of place airplane in Ohio away from being fired BEFORE the Alabama game
EVENT : Then, the AD and President get canned, a booster starts down the long road to shun-ville, and Tuberville keeps smiling and saying the right things
EVENT : He talks his two running backs and two stellar DB's into staying, then knocks out 15 straight wins and signs one of those super iron-clad contracts that will pay him 14 million over seven years, and if Auburn even thinks...THINKS about letting him go, they owe him every penny

EVENT : He could have sex with an endangered Bald Eagle, and they'd STILL have to pay him
EVENT : Much like the "I told you so's" everyone is throwing at the UGA basketball program after their hiring and subsequent firing of The Harricks, folks around the Buckeye state have to be having similar thoughts

EVENT : It seems that AD and frequent "No we didn't" Ohio State front man Andy Geiger is "retiring" after 11 years at the helm
EVENT : Of course, it was discovered that his men's basketball coach had directly given six grand to a Yugoslavian recruit, but that was just his stipend for travel and coach Jim O'Brien was just having a problem with the currency exchange rates...right Andy
EVENT : Allegations have come to light that several OSU players received illegal benefits including cash, access to cars, etc
EVENT : It shouldn't surprise Buckeye fans either, since Tressel had similar problems at Youngstown State, and left a wake of controversy behind himself there as well, including (surprise) illegal benefits including cash, cars, grade fixing, etc
EVENT : The first thing that needs to happen is that Bettman and Goodenow (the players' association rep) need to be fired, deported, flogged, tarred and feathered and finally forced to pay for four tickets plus a program, four dogs, four beers, and two cokes and parking to a game at an NHL arena for every day of the next season so they understand what the fans go thru to see a hockey game
EVENT : That means no team would own any player, and the owners would be free to sign whomever they'd like using the "fiscal restraint" they all droned on and on about all year

EVENT : Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia , a company whose name is so breathtakingly self-promoting it makes me long for the days when every single entity involve in real estate or casinos was called Trump, continues to soar; it rose $1.78, or 7.29%, on news that the company's namesake will star in a new TV show once she, er... gets out of prison
EVENT : Now, I know there have been succesful companies that dealt with crooks (Warner Communications, which started as a merger between business in the three most mob-influenced industries around, comes to mind), but it's a gamble and not a business strategy
EVENT : The company's performance wasn't all that hot even before the CEO went to prison, and until very recently the stock price reflected that
EVENT : And she's been convincted of obstruction of justice
EVENT : This runup is based on the inexplicable hope that now that the head of the firm and the embodiment of a much-resented brand is no longer doing time for lying to the Federal government, they'll be able to really coin some money
EVENT : You have company coming over for dinner
EVENT : You're hosting a wedding reception
EVENT : That business is O-V-E-R -- Between pay-per-view, video-on-demand, pirated movies, high-bandwidth Internet broadcasts, and the increasing availability of other media, it takes some faith to see any future for movie rentals
EVENT : Of course, there have been companies whose performance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea, but Psuedo.com failed without producing a single show, and Broadcast.com was swallowed for $6 billion by Yahoo!, to Yahoo!'s great regret
EVENT : Of course, there have been companies whose performance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea, but Psuedo.com failed without producing a single show, and Broadcast.com was swallowed for $6 billion by Yahoo!, to Yahoo!'s great regret
EVENT : The recent rumors about WalMart's plans to buy out a shipping company have given rise to the fear that the company may go the conglomerate route
EVENT : So Oracle and Peoplesoft , who spent the last 18 months insulting one another in every imaginable way, are finally tying the knot
EVENT : Ellison is brilliant enough to make this merger work, but he's crazy enough to wreck even the soundest of deals
EVENT : I'll have to stick with condemning the merger as a totally unworkable deal between two sides who absolutely hate each other
EVENT : And I won't dwell on the irony of an Oracle employee being driven out of Oracle, starting his own company, and forcing Ellison to spend $10.3 billion to get his company -- but not him -- back (though it does rather delightfully remind me of Coca-Cola basically giving away the bottling franchise and then spending billions to buy it back

EVENT : How much of Peoplesoft's most valuable -- human -- resources will walk out the door the day their options vest
EVENT : Needless to say, Wynn sold when everyone else bought, and he made it through the cannibalizing near-collapse those casinos faced in the early 90's
EVENT : The company intended to use the cash to pay an artificially low price for Yukos assets
EVENT : The company intended to use the cash to pay an artificially low price for Yukos assets (hence that firm's bankruptcy filing a few days ago -- you know it's bad when you have to use US courts to protect your own assets from appropriation by your home country
EVENT : It turns out the anonymous company, BaikalFinansGroup, shares an address with OOO Tverneftemash, which was recently bought by ZAO Gazpromgeocomservice, not to ever be confused by the similarly-named Gazprom (which by the way has a similar logo
EVENT : Auctioneers reported a $9.3 billion winning bid for Yuganskneftgaz -- the company's main asset, worth two to three times that amount -- by an anonymous company located in Tver
EVENT : Gazprom may have arranged some last-minute debt financing, or might have an outside partner, but I seriously doubt they weren't in some way involved with the company that won the auction
EVENT : everyone thinks they can always sell to someone dumber
EVENT : Anyway, I still think the Vioxx risk is overestimated -- if the tobacco industry can sell something with no health benefits for years, get sued, and 1) Keep the product on the shelves, 2) Remain in business, and 3) do 2) to the tune of several billion dollars per year in profits, we Merckers might be safe
EVENT : It's a dying organization, and this will be just the jolt it needs for another couple decades of somnambulant staggering before being ultimately replaced by far more efficient companies
EVENT : The Capital Spectator reports on the latest: Not only China, but India's state oil company has decided to get into the Yukos-dismemberment trade
EVENT : Frenetic merger and acquisition activity doesn't mean much in the early days of a business -- it's just as likely that ridiculously overfunded startups are buying out their bankrupt competitors to create larger and less stable conglomerates as it is that forward-thinking visionaries are cutting off their competitors early

EVENT : But when an outsider buys into the business once it's established itself as important, but before it's really gotten profitable, it's big news
EVENT : For now, it's just a rumor that Ask Jeeves is buying Bloglines
EVENT : Apparently Yuganskneftegaz, which was sold to an independent buyer who turned out to be an apparatus of the state (yes, the same state that 1) forced Yukos to do the auction, and 2) ran the auction, not that 3) this is suspicious or anything), and which was then being bought with foreign assistance, is not being bought with foreign assistance
EVENT : As of this morning, at least. Anyway, it looks like they're denying Chinese involvement to avoid a lawsuit , which is funny -- you'd think they might know someone in the Russian judiciary who could help them out
EVENT : Today, Ask Jeeves made their official announcement about acquiring Bloglines
EVENT : And this is, as far as I know, the first time since the Allegheny deal that there's been a hostile takeover using debt
EVENT : And now, they're swallowed by Just Another Monolith
EVENT : And then MCI just sort of accepted a Verizon deal without really bothering anybody
EVENT : Will we have that at the Fed, when Greenspan leaves
EVENT : Northshore Management, the hedge fund firm accused of stealing millions of dollars in client funds, is now facing actual SEC action
EVENT : Though, of course, there's always the chance that these fund managers were stupid and shortsighted, not actually criminal; apparently, the money stolen was lent to or invested in companies the managers controlled -- so they're guilty of front-running, at the least
EVENT : While North Carolina's excise tax is only 5 cents, the total taxes given to North Carolina by smokers adds up to more than 61 cents per pack
EVENT : Okay, okay -- since the tobacco companies pay lots of money to the states, that's technically accurate
EVENT : I'd love to call it a classic raid -- he's making an offer for the company, nominating his own board, claiming management can accept one or the other or both, and hinting that if they paid him enough, he'd probably go away
EVENT : In this case, the most interesting twist is that he's shorting shares of Mylan's acquisition target, King Pharmaceuticals; he's basically doubling down on the bet that they won't acquire
EVENT : Not only that, but if Mylan bought him out, they'd have less money to fund a purchase of King Pharmaceuticals

EVENT : In this case, the most interesting twist is that he's shorting shares of Mylan's acquisition target, King Pharmaceuticals; he's basically doubling down on the bet that they won't acquire

EVENT : Our president has repeatedly, for example, relied on a man whom you're aware, Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, leader of the Iraq arms program who defected for a time
EVENT : Bob, one of the reasons I think so many Americans are worried about this war and so many people around the world don't want to go is there have been a lot of problems with credibility from this administration
EVENT : The fact that this guy was such an idiot to go back and let his father-in-law kill him shows he wasn't the most stable of people
EVENT : Let me tell you, what trips to Walter Reed taught me was, that whoever thought up the term, the law of unintended consequences it pertains to war

EVENT : Over 80,000 Americans, 220 every day die from medical negligence, hundred of thousands are injured
EVENT : That runs against the fact that so many of them are just leaving their practice because they can't afford it
EVENT : And what we're finding now is that the emergency rooms are closing, trauma centers are closing, pregnant women can't find a doctor to deliver the baby, a boy knocked unconscious has to be transported to another state
EVENT : The patient had to be airavacked and by that time it was too late to prevent the brain damage
EVENT : Well, as much as they've poured into those coffers, it's much less than what the doctors, the malpractice insurers, the hospital chains and the HMOs and the nursing home chains have poured into members of Congress' coffers
EVENT : Are we going to allow severely injured people who have found a lung taken out that's the wrong lung or a double mastectomy that wasn't indicated that was inflicted on a woman in the Midwest, or that organ transplant that was incompatible on that 17-year-old teenager in North Carolina

EVENT : She died awaiting surgery
EVENT : Does that look like a Lottery winner to you, holding a picture of his dead baby
EVENT : But I wonder if you can respond to Mr. McCormick's point. Who are you, who's our president to tell him that his suffering is only worth $250,000 for the loss of a child

EVENT : The average number of suits against a neurosurgeon is five in South Florida
EVENT : If harmed by a doc, they ought to be able to recover their economic costs, economic losses
EVENT : Let me set aside the hypocrisy of a man who became president because of a lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else's lawsuits, but instead focus on his own experience
EVENT : And the entire pay-out to all of the victims that get a little money, not the 90 percent who never file a claim, amounts to less than what we spend on dog food
EVENT : It's about $5.4 billion is the pay-out
EVENT : payoffs have been stable, adjusted for inflation, National Practitioners Databank
EVENT : Both the AMA and the Bush administration released reports this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of their practices all across the country
EVENT : President Bush points this way today, even the most frivolous of lawsuits cost money, premiums go up and either way, the patient pays

EVENT : It has refused in the last five years to revoke the license of a single doctor for committing medical errors
EVENT : If there are any bad doctors we want them removed from the practice of medicine
EVENT : Doctors are leaving practice because of insurance premium, right
EVENT : Well, let's look at what the president is actually proposing for people who have been harmed by a bad doctor
EVENT : Seventy percent of the cases filed are told there's no payment
EVENT : Because someone pays money in a case, the insurance company may pay money because they're afraid there's is going to be a giant award in this case because of this broken liability system
EVENT : But here in Washington, President Bush says it's all a hoax, and many believe he has already made up his mind to go to war
EVENT : Congressman Sanders, you're opposed to this war
EVENT : When the guns begin to fire, when the American men and women are in harm's way and may be dying, is that now the time for you and your allies to shut up and support the troops
EVENT : Well it's not -- are you suggesting that when tens and thousands of Iraqi women and children are killed, and when young men and women in this country are unnecessarily put at harm's risk, what should we do
EVENT : And obviously we're going to pray that there's fewer casualties
EVENT : Are you going to demonstrate against them in the streets

EVENT : I'm not crazy about it myself
EVENT : No, it's so important -- you know this -- and I know it's fun and we love doing partisan Punch & Judy, but is there ever a time when we stand up even if we respectfully disagree with the commander in chief and those who would wage war
EVENT : For example -- wait a second -- in Iran, the reason that you had Ayatollah Khomeini in power is he overthrew the Shah
EVENT : You who put the Shah in power
EVENT : But the problem with Khomeini was that the guy who he overthrew was put in power by the United States
EVENT : But the problem with Khomeini was that the guy who he overthrew was put in power by the United States
EVENT : We overthrew (UNINTELLIGIBLE) and put the Shah of Iran in power
EVENT : We overthrew (UNINTELLIGIBLE) and put the Shah of Iran in power
EVENT : But I mean you're attacking the CIA for putting him in, when it was -- the problem was Khomeini
EVENT : The way we caught that guy was by coordinating with our allies
EVENT : The same weekend they arrested the guy, we had
EVENT : And I'm curious, how can Democrats claim that President Bush is ignoring the war on terror if al Qaeda's second key operative was just caught
EVENT : We had no part in it
EVENT : No, it was a joint effort by Pakistan
EVENT : Why do we want to sever that relationship with this idiotic war in Iraq

EVENT : We don't need war
EVENT : They're not pointing out that inspections are working only because there's the credible threat of war
EVENT : The essence of the American case for war against Saddam Hussein
EVENT : President Bush wants the Security Council to explicitly authorize force against Iraq, and his press secretary today remained optimistic that in the end, that's just what he'll get
EVENT : It doesn't mean we have to go to war
EVENT : But I think President Bush should get credit for pushing to instructions and backing them up with the threat of force
EVENT : It means when you take the threat of force of the table, you're likely to stop disarming Saddam Hussein
EVENT : Yes, I'm not saying take the threat of force
EVENT : I'm saying we don't need to use force right now
EVENT : Saddam wouldn't be destroying missiles unless he thought he was going to be destroyed if he didn't
EVENT : Well, those of you who still believe the myth of the liberal media should consider this: MSNBC, an obscure cable channel, has fired Phil Donahue, the host of its highest-rated show
EVENT : Phil Donahue was fired because he's a liberal
EVENT : A memo from inside NBC, reported on the Web site allyourtv.com, and today in "The Washington Post," shows NBC big wigs feared that the liberal Mr. Donahue represented in the words of the NBC memo -- quote -- "a difficult public face for NBC at a time of war, while our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity because he seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti-war, anti-Bush and skeptical of the administration's motives

EVENT : In a moment, we'll ask two members of Congress if they're convinced that war is the only way to make Saddam Hussein disarm
EVENT : Later, the pope practices religion and a little anti-war politics on the side
EVENT : Congressman Rangel, a couple of months ago Senator Daschle on CBS said -- made the charge that we are, quote, "we haven't made any real progress in the war against al Qaeda
EVENT : And how'd they get them
EVENT : Secretary of State Colin Powell goes to the U.N. tomorrow to do what he can
EVENT : We're talking with potential war in Iraq with Congressman Charlie Rangel, a New York Democrat and his fellow New Yorker Republican Congressman Peter King
EVENT : One of the reasons that we like having you on, and as well as Mr. Rangel, is that, you know, this is war, as we were saying in the last segment
EVENT : You treat it with the gravity and the seriousness that it deserves
EVENT : Isn't that wrong in a time of war
EVENT : You treat it with the gravity and the seriousness that it deserves
EVENT : One of the most admired men in the world is doing everything he can to avert the horror of war
EVENT : If they don't have the pencil that's keeping score, they ought to keep their mouth shut because as a former federal prosecutor, every drug dealer I busted was the most important drug dealer in the world
EVENT : You just pass out numbers on whoever you arrest
EVENT : Because he helped plan the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon
EVENT : Let me tell you, when you arrest somebody, you describe who you're arresting
EVENT : Listen, we should be arresting a lot of people
EVENT : We should do all of those things, but the most important thing is we should not have the arrogance to have a preemptive strike against a defenseless nation without the
EVENT : They have it and we supported them having it when they were fighting Iran so it's no big deal there
EVENT : And the thing is that if we can disarm them without actually going there, killing them, I really think that we maintain our moral authority around the world
EVENT : I mean, what happens if India decides that they could have a preemptive strike against Pakistan
EVENT : I don't think we have to kill to prove that
EVENT : That Europe is against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds, but the U.S. is for the war because it wants to profit for the oil companies
EVENT : I think it's unwise, it's unjust, it's unwarranted, but I don't think it's about oil
EVENT : The people are against it
EVENT : Time now for "Fireback," where our wacky and kooky fans and friends and critics right in
EVENT : Don from Denver, Colorado writes, "Paul, you keep referencing Halliburton selling equipment to Iraq" -- which I do
EVENT : Chad Hensley, from Fairfax, Virginia, writes, "France, Russia and German have all multi-billion dollar oil deals with Saddam in Iraq
EVENT : But it has nothing to do whether we should go to war with Iraq or not
EVENT : I wonder why they protest the war with Iraq
EVENT : That Europe is against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds, but the U.S. is for the war because it wants to profit for the oil companies
EVENT : I don't believe for a minute that this is a war for oil
EVENT : Now, the reason that France, Russia and Germany are against war is because they have democracies
EVENT : He's trying to lead us into a war against one of his valued customers
EVENT : What does that have to do with the war in Iraq
EVENT : On the other hand, the region is pretty unstable, filled with people who already hate Americans and seek to do America harm
EVENT : And I was just curious if you feel that the attack on Iraq would actually open a Pandora's box in other Middle Eastern countries that we are known to aid and harbor terrorists, such as Syria and Iran
EVENT : And my question is, after today's meeting in Paris, where France, Russia and Germany decided to not back a second resolution, who is not (UNINTELLIGIBLE)? Is it the U.S. or is it old Europe
EVENT : Who sends troops to die on our side
EVENT : We know that some of the American troops now fighting in Iraq are longtime veterans of warfare, probably not most, but some
EVENT : So what is it like for them to face combat far from home
EVENT : For an idea, here is CNN's Candy Crowley with some war stories
EVENT : There's nothing very pretty about the training that you take to prepare you for combat, because it is to kill people
EVENT : Staff Sergeant Tom Ridge opened fire
EVENT : A Viet Cong soldier dropped dead
EVENT : Did you at the time or have you since looked back and pondered on killing someone
EVENT : Duke Cunningham was a Vietnam fighter ace shooting down five enemy planes
EVENT : Duke, what's it like to kill somebody
EVENT : And I went to the priest, because it bothered me
EVENT : I knew I could do it again
EVENT : But I didn't know it was going to bother me as much as it did
EVENT : And it still does
EVENT : War may sometimes be a necessary thing, but it can never be a natural thing
EVENT : it
EVENT : Sergeant Chuck Hagel was seriously wounded twice in Vietnam
EVENT : You are trying to kill people, because the alternative is, if you are in combat, you will be killed
EVENT : Training is what keeps you running toward the front while trucks loaded with dead bodies pass you, going the other way
EVENT : Later, when he was wounded and trapped behind enemy lines in Korea, Staff Sergeant Charlie Rangel led 40 men, fighting their way to safety
EVENT : If you're killing people, it's out of fear, not really, in my opinion, out of bravery
EVENT : Rangel, Cunningham, Ridge and Hagel are all proud, decorated combat veterans
EVENT : It's just, a decade later, killing still troubles the soul
EVENT : Did you do it again
EVENT : I shot down four more MiGs
EVENT : As they get ready to head over hostile territory, 10 men aboard this Air Force HC-130 search and rescue and refueling plane start to feel their adrenaline rushing

EVENT : Well, as coalition forces push north, they are encountering a unique problem of combat, getting rid of the weapons captured from the enemy
EVENT : Seemingly deserted, these battered buildings hold a deadly threat to British forces in Iraq
EVENT : What stops though - we know the Iraqis have fired sand missiles and fired AAA at aircraft all throughout this war
EVENT : They haven't hit anybody, but isn't it risky flying so low knowing they have that ammunition to fire at you
EVENT : We know where they're at so we simply avoid them and if for some reason they do get off a lucky shot or they do see us, we have defensive systems on board the airplane to defeat their ammunition
EVENT : The plane arrived back to base safely
EVENT : Eight hundred of those sorties will be strike sorties using bombs and missiles so there is no slow down in the amount of air power being used over Iraq

EVENT : At the Pentagon briefing today, General Stanley McChrystal said that it looked a lot like terrorism
EVENT : It looks and feels like terrorism and what it requires is units to conduct forced production activities which they are prepared and do all the time but clearly when you see a tactic like this, it requires strict adherence or adjustments to your tactics, techniques and procedures to ensure that places like checkpoints are not vulnerable
EVENT : No injuries reported
EVENT : Well, no major concern. The Pentagon says that they do have air dominance as they now call it over the vast majority of the country that there are certain areas and only certain areas of downtown Iraq where battle management radars linked to surface to air missiles are still in tact

EVENT : Well, this is something that we've been trying to get a grip on for years, exactly what the Iraqi people feel and also that I think the best evidence that we had before the attack began was that Iraqis do, they despise
EVENT : They are desperate to be rid of him but by the same token, they don't like another country coming into their country to overturn the government and beyond that, I think it's probably most important for most Iraqis is they're deeply suspicious of the United States
EVENT : Ken Pollack, that resistance that we just saw the British troops dealing with, you and I were talking earlier today
EVENT : The story the last few days has been the surprising level of resistance but you're telling me your sense is that the coalition forces are beginning to adjust to that
EVENT : Chances are the Iraqis are going to continue to stick with what we've seen before, irregular forces blending in with civilians trying to attack U.S. forces, some more of these suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops
EVENT : Chances are the Iraqis are going to continue to stick with what we've seen before, irregular forces blending in with civilians trying to attack U.S. forces, some more of these suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops
EVENT : One last thing, Ken Pollack I want to ask about this British officials saying that they have information that Saddam Hussein has fired his air defense chief
EVENT : Well, if it's true and obviously we don't know just yet but if it's true, it is very significant because it's effectively the Iraqis admitting that many of the civilian casualties that we've seen over the last few days may in fact have been caused by Iraqi surface to air missiles falling back to ground in residential areas
EVENT : Exactly, in that market and I think it was pretty apparent when you looked at the video of that market, if that had been a U.S. bomb or a U.S. cruise missile, that market would have been obliterated
EVENT : Now precisely what they're hitting to the south of us is unclear but my understanding is that there are further Iraqi positions in that direction as well
EVENT : Ben Wedeman describing coalition hits in the area where he is, the town of Kalak in northern Iraq
EVENT : He just called in and we wanted to get this report to you right away
EVENT : Five huge explosions within the space of less than an hour as these planes drop these massive bombs on the Iraqi positions behind us
EVENT : In addition to that, we know that further back behind those lines in the direction of Mosul there is heavy artillery and tanks as well, this according to the people here in this area, the local Kurds who have been going across the lines for many years basically engaged in smuggling

EVENT : Judy, you're seeing us through the night scope because basically for the last hour we've been watching as this ridge behind me in Kalak which of course is the front line between Iraq and Kurdish (ph) forces, we've been watching as planes, planes we can hear but cannot see, have been bombing the ridge line behind us
EVENT : Five huge explosions within the space of less than an hour as these planes drop these massive bombs on the Iraqi positions behind us
EVENT : We've also seen some massive blasts to the south as well so it appears that this bombing in this area continues and we have really seen the most intense bombing of the war in this area in the last 24 hours
EVENT : We've also seen some massive blasts to the south as well so it appears that this bombing in this area continues and we have really seen the most intense bombing of the war in this area in the last 24 hours
EVENT : Well, basically on the ridge itself it is the most forward Iraqi army positions and we've been watching them very closely for the last month prior to the war to the outbreak of the war and basically these are the positions that control this entire valley
EVENT : We've also seen some massive blasts to the south as well so it appears that this bombing in this area continues and we have really seen the most intense bombing of the war in this area in the last 24 hours
EVENT : We've also seen some massive blasts to the south as well so it appears that this bombing in this area continues and we have really seen the most intense bombing of the war in this area in the last 24 hours
EVENT : Rusty, what sort of crowd is showing up there
EVENT : As our convoy rolled through southern Iraq the desperation of the people here soon became evident
EVENT : In trucks and on foot they came to the town of Safwan
EVENT : When we come back, one of the many sad aspects of this war, humanitarian aid rushed to people who need it but not everybody gets what they came for
EVENT : When we return, Americans this weekend are marching against the war and in support of the troops
EVENT : Hopefully it will be a short war
EVENT : These people have been without food or water supplies since the war began
EVENT : We hate any state in war here
EVENT : Hopefully it will be a short war
EVENT : It will be attack the Iraqi regime
EVENT : Delivery drivers were threatened
EVENT : One of the buses in our convoy was held up at knifepoint
EVENT : The troops have moved into Safwan
EVENT : When we return, Americans this weekend are marching against the war and in support of the troops
EVENT : We'll check out some of the demonstrations
EVENT : Here in the United States this weekend just as they did last weekend, anti-war protesters taking to the street
EVENT : In Los Angeles, the International Black Coalition for Peace and Justice is sponsoring a rally for peace today
EVENT : This has been a very peaceful demonstration
EVENT : This has been a very peaceful demonstration
EVENT : Bessam Al-Husaini here and it has been a very peaceful demonstration
EVENT : In the meantime further north in California, San Francisco is the setting today for a rally aimed at boosting the moral of the American troops in the Persian Gulf region
EVENT : This has been a very peaceful demonstration
EVENT : As I said, the officers did tell me that this is the largest pro-troops demonstration that has ever been in San Francisco since the Vietnam War
EVENT : This has been a very peaceful demonstration
EVENT : Bessam Al-Husaini here and it has been a very peaceful demonstration
EVENT : Well Judy, this is the largest group really we've seen of the support the troops rallies that have been over the last few weeks
EVENT : Of course this is the home of the anti- war demonstrations stemming back to the Vietnam War but there are close to between 500 and 1,000 people

EVENT : How do you feel though seeing pictures of civilians injured in the bombings
EVENT : How do you feel though seeing pictures of civilians injured in the bombings
EVENT : We get reports that these civilians especially in the (INAUDIBLE) population have been attacked by the Iraqi regime themselves so they can't blame the American and said look what the American doing to us
EVENT : Mostly small arms fire, but the sand storm has enabled the Iraqis to come very close to the road, and if I sound a little nervous, it's because we're in the soft skin vehicle and everybody else is in armor
EVENT : Of course, you're on an adrenaline high, but racing across the desert, you know that you're traveling toward the jaws of what could be a major military battle
EVENT : Just ahead we'll have the latest on today's suicide bombing in Israel
EVENT : It was the first unit to cross the Euphrates River and then punch northward to within 60 miles of Baghdad
EVENT : It was the first unit to cross the Euphrates River and then punch northward to within 60 miles of Baghdad
EVENT : We've had an absolutely terrific story, pushing forward north toward Baghdad
EVENT : Seventy-two hours of that was under constant fire coming at us from both sides of the road
EVENT : Recall Winston Churchill's old quote, "There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at and missed
EVENT : We have under heavy fire for the past couple of miles
EVENT : Mostly small arms fire, but the sand storm has enabled the Iraqis to come very close to the road, and if I sound a little nervous, it's because we're in the soft skin vehicle and everybody else is in armor
EVENT : The U.S. Army's 7th Cavalry has just taken three Iraqi prisoners of war
EVENT : The Army is eating much, much better than the grandfathers of these soldiers did and the great grandfathers of these soldiers in the Second World War
EVENT : Just ahead we'll have the latest on today's suicide bombing in Israel
EVENT : There had been many terrorist attacks here in Netanya, including the deadliest suicide bombing ever in Israel almost exactly a year ago, March 27, at the Park Hotel during Passover, 29 people killed in that attack
EVENT : We will be back later on the war in Iraq
EVENT : It had been very quiet inside Israel since the start of the U.s.-led war against Iraq
EVENT : Israel has been on a heightened state of alert since the start of the U.S.-led war against Iraq
EVENT : But first, we want to go somewhere else in the region to tell you that dozens were injured today in the first suicide bombing in Israel in three weeks
EVENT : Dozens, though, injured, including some Israeli soldiers, because according to an eyewitness, he said many soldiers were here also enjoying the spring weather
EVENT : But first, we want to go somewhere else in the region to tell you that dozens were injured today in the first suicide bombing in Israel in three weeks
EVENT : CNN's Kelly Wallace reports on today's attack in Netanya
EVENT : Police say a suicide bomber blew himself up outside this cafe, called The London Cafe, earlier Sunday afternoon
EVENT : As for this attack, the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad is claiming responsibility
EVENT : According to a leaflet from the group obtained by CNN, the group says the attack was to show the union of Palestinians with the people of Iraq
EVENT : And now many Israelis fear they could see more attacks like the one they saw here today as the military campaign against Saddam Hussein continues
EVENT : Many here though say they are relieved only one person dead, the suicide bomber
EVENT : There had been many terrorist attacks here in Netanya, including the deadliest suicide bombing ever in Israel almost exactly a year ago, March 27, at the Park Hotel during Passover, 29 people killed in that attack

EVENT : The group is also claiming that Islamic Jihad militants are already inside Iraq to carry out attacks against U.S. and British forces
EVENT : And now many Israelis fear they could see more attacks like the one they saw here today as the military campaign against Saddam Hussein continues
EVENT : Throughout the day, as the U.S. Army 7th Cavalry punched northward in the general direction of Baghdad, we have seen huge convoys of supply troops moving ever northward
EVENT : Additionally, the 7th Cavalry has pushed onward in the general direction of Baghdad
EVENT : There were times when the 7th Cavalry itself got into some skirmishes as it pushed forward, again in the direction of Baghdad
EVENT : U.S. Army's 7th Cavalry is in the forefront of U.S. troops since they first left Kuwait and crossed directly into the Iraqi desert
EVENT : The Apache troop opened its tank guns, opened its own mortars, decimated that unit, put it out of existence and probably killed some 20 Iraqis in the process
EVENT : The Apache troop opened its tank guns, opened its own mortars, decimated that unit, put it out of existence and probably killed some 20 Iraqis in the process
EVENT : Throughout the day, we have watched the 3rd Infantry Division bring in prisoners of war
EVENT : Iraqi soldiers glad the war is over for them, perhaps 100 at a time
EVENT : The toughest fight, though, may lie ahead in the heart of the Iraqi capital
EVENT : Pentagon sources say the first phase of the final push into Baghdad is now under way
EVENT : U.S.-led forces were able to press farther north after defeating Iraqi Republican Guard units at Karbala and Kut (ph
EVENT : U.S.-led forces were able to press farther north after defeating Iraqi Republican Guard units at Karbala and Kut (ph
EVENT : Our embedded reporters say the two-pronged advance appears to be moving faster than commanders expected
EVENT : Iraqis who initially were cautious when U.S. forces arrived in Najaf ended cheering them on, shaking their hands and patting their backs
EVENT : U.S. Army's 7th Cavalry is in the forefront of U.S. troops since they first left Kuwait and crossed directly into the Iraqi desert
EVENT : Our Walter Rodgers is embedded with the unit's 3rd Squadron, which is leading the 3rd Infantry Division's march toward the Iraqi capital
EVENT : There were times when the 7th Cavalry itself got into some skirmishes as it pushed forward, again in the direction of Baghdad
EVENT : Earlier in the day, the 1st Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division took Karbala with a minimum of fight
EVENT : There was a bit of a firefight when the 7th Cavalry came upon three Soviet vintage 20- millimeter anti-aircraft guns, ack-ack guns
EVENT : The Iraqi unit in possession of those guns fired mortars in the direction of the 7th Cavalry
EVENT : The Apache troop opened its tank guns, opened its own mortars, decimated that unit, put it out of existence and probably killed some 20 Iraqis in the process
EVENT : This as it continues to push ever closer towards the southern suburbs of Baghdad
EVENT : The speed as they push to Baghdad seems to have gathered pace overnight and in the course of this morning
EVENT : The intensity it's very quick moving, very fluid battle
EVENT : Overnight and early this morning, the tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles of the 3rd Infantry Division backed by the Apache attack helicopters of the 11th Aviation Regiment punched through the Republican Guard defenses in and around Karbala
EVENT : They were then able to advance far north of that city and, as we speak, U.S. commanders tell me that elements of the 3rd Infantry Division are now literally just a few miles from Baghdad
EVENT : That's CNN's Karl Penhaul with the very latest from the battlefront
EVENT : So, in regard to that, we are paying great attention to their ability to defend on the ground
EVENT : The Army's 3rd Infantry has punched through Karbala, meeting only light resistance from the Medina Republican Guard, and moving along highway nine within 25 miles of Baghdad
EVENT : He said, quote, "The dagger is clearly pointed at the heart of the regime now, and it will remain pointed at it," he said, "until the regime is gone

NEVENT : Again I apologize for the lack of updates over the past few days and will use this space to recap a weekend that was both good and bad
NEVENT : On Friday a small group of friends and I attended a most-righteous Sister Hazel concert at Floyd's Music Store for the third straight, and for the third straight year I was blown away by one of my favorite live bands
NEVENT : Sister Hazel has a way of becoming intimate with the fans by brining them into the show
NEVENT : It's something you can always expect from these guys, unlike so many other performers, and is why I never miss a show when they're in town
NEVENT : Naturally, I dressed up as Hugh Hefner and took the role of making sure everyone was having a good time
NEVENT : I have yet to hear any complaints from any of the guests
NEVENT : On Saturday the Seminoles were bested by unranked Maryland; effectively ending our chances at a national title this year
NEVENT : In addition, the quarterback controversy has once again debouched as Chris Rix almost took us to victory with his deep threat
NEVENT : Fortunately the agony of defeat was blanketed somewhat by our Halloween party and I won't have to worry about Seminole Football until next Saturday
NEVENT : On Sunday we saw Saw and as expected I was less than satisfied
NEVENT : It was neither better nor worse than last week's The Grudge but the trailers beforehand dictate that the end of this year and the beginning of 2005 will bring us a large quantity of horror movies
NEVENT : If I enjoy one out of five considering the genre I can say it's worth it
NEVENT : I wish I could have been at a Pub, or wherever these people convene, to see the reactions from all the Britons who read the Telegraph this morning (emphasis added)
NEVENT : The Home Office and police chiefs should instead tackle the possession of guns in criminal hands, said Prof Mauser, a member of the independent Fraser Institute in Canada
NEVENT : He has given evidence to select committees of the House of Commons and the Canadian Senate and predicted the escalation of gun crime on Britain's streets
NEVENT : I believe that factors of political correctness are at work, he said
NEVENT : Police crackdowns, Home Office initiatives and over-regulation of legally held weapons create froth and they may even fool the police themselves into believing they are doing something about gun crime
NEVENT : Recorded gun crime rose by three per cent to 10,590 incidents in the year to June
NEVENT : Two-thirds of gun crime takes place in London, Birmingham and Manchester
NEVENT : It doesn't matter to these people that crime has skyrocketed since the irrational ban on private gun possession went into effect in Great Britain
NEVENT : Just as long as it's there, they feel safe
NEVENT : I can see why he would do it
NEVENT : He was probably running around being shot at for days on end in Falluja
NEVENT : There should be an investigation but they should look into the circumstances, said Lance Corporal Christopher Hanson
NEVENT : Two shots to the head, said Sergeant Nicholas Graham, 24, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
NEVENT : You can't trust these people
NEVENT : He should not be investigated
NEVENT : He did nothing wrong
NEVENT : I've got too many friends in Iraq right now I want to see come home alive and well, and I will support them at every opportunity
NEVENT : I didn't mean to wait this long and never intended to ignore the issue, but I have been extremely busy last week with Thanksgiving and everything that goes along with it
NEVENT : This is problem that needs to be addressed
NEVENT : As this article points out, the SKS wasn't included on the list of banned weapons as part of the 10-year ban on certain assault weapons signed by President Clinton
NEVENT : The SKS is a medium-powered carbine equipped with a 10-round magazine, just like the pistol I'm displaying in the photo on the left hand side of this blog
NEVENT : Banned weapons had capacities of more than 10 rounds; so like my small 9mm, the SKS was not classified as an assault weapon
NEVENT : So let's not center our discussion around the gun, let's talk about the person behind the trigger
NEVENT : Well, we'll debate that later on in the show
NEVENT : We'll have a couple of experts come out, so I'll withhold my comments until then
NEVENT : Now, why has our president placed homeland security in the hands of Republican political hacks instead of professionals, by the way?
NEVENT : Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example, is a career politician
NEVENT : Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge is another career politician who was passed over by Mr. Bush for the vice presidency
NEVENT : And Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Asa Hutchinson is yet another career politician and a graduate of the disgraceful Bob Jones University
NEVENT : Apparently, Mr. Bush only turns to professionals when it's really important, like political consulting
NEVENT : And you know what, they did a hell of a job for our country
NEVENT : Our president has put homeland security in the hands of failed Republican hacks
NEVENT : So it's OK -- it's OK to have professional politicians at the Justice
NEVENT : Department and the Pentagon...
NEVENT : Janet Reno was a career prosecutor
NEVENT : ust a minute, let me finish my sentence, please
NEVENT : No, the difference is Janet Reno was a career prosecutor
NEVENT : John Ashcroft wasn't half the woman that Janet Reno was
NEVENT : Another potential Democratic presidential candidate pondered whether to run, and he made his announcement, and surprise, surprise, the answer was no
NEVENT : Why not? Surely Chris Dodd is at least more credible than Carol Moseley-Braun or Dennis Kucinich
NEVENT : I guess that means harassing Tom Ridge, fighting tax cuts and obstructing President Bush's plans to reform judiciary. Some two years
NEVENT : God, I hope so
NEVENT : that's all I can say
NEVENT : I love Senator Dodd
NEVENT : He would have brought a lot to the race
NEVENT : He brings a lot to the Senate and to the debate
NEVENT : And I'm glad that he's going to be fighting those fights
NEVENT : Well, the Commerce Department reports today that consumer spending declined in January and that the manufacturing sector slowed in February
NEVENT : Meanwhile, the deficit now at $300 billion
NEVENT : Mr. Bush apparently is untroubled by this fiscal collapse
NEVENT : One of his aides tells the current issue of "TIME," magazine, quote, "even if it's $500 billion, so what?"
NEVENT : Of course, even a $500 billion deficit number doesn't count the $3 trillion Mr. Bush is robbing from the Social Security trust fund
NEVENT : You know, we should have known, every time George W. Bush gets in trouble, he borrows from a trust fund. It's been his whole life, you know
NEVENT : Let me give you two economic facts of like, which you should know, even if you won't recognize them
NEVENT : Number one, there is absolutely no relationship between the deficit and unemployment
NEVENT : They don't go together
NEVENT : And number two, there is no Social Security fund, Virginia
NEVENT : There just isn't one
NEVENT : Because Bush squandered it on his tax cuts
NEVENT : There never has been one
NEVENT : There has been one for 60 years
NEVENT : Welcome back
NEVENT : Bob, one of the reasons I think so many Americans are worried about this war and so many people around the world don't want to go is there have been a lot of problems with credibility from this administration
NEVENT : Bad move
NEVENT : But while he was here, he gave us a whole lot of information
NEVENT : Gave us a whole lot of information
NEVENT : Well, our president told us that information proves that the dictator had chemical weapons, which is true
NEVENT : But what we just learned this week from Newsweek magazine which got a hold of the debriefings, is that he also told us it was destroyed back in 1995
NEVENT : Why hasn't our president told us that? Why do we have to learn it from Newsweek
NEVENT : I don't believe that he believed it was all destroyed
NEVENT : Good point
NEVENT : But shouldn't our president have told us what the CIA told him
NEVENT : Why do we learn from Newsweek
NEVENT : Should he level with us
NEVENT : Bush isn't sitting in that White House not thinking about the body bags coming home with great young men
NEVENT : I was at the medal of honor ceremony for the kids
NEVENT : I am shook over the aftermath
NEVENT : But, this guy is a monster, a mini-me Hitler
NEVENT : Take a look at it
NEVENT : That's pretty good support isn't it
NEVENT : Now, Bob, come on you don't really buy this
NEVENT : I mean, listen, this is the oldest trick in the book
NEVENT : You can have a general question like this that could mean anything and ask people and they give you what comes off the top of their head
NEVENT : But, ask them another question, ask them what they think about spending $1.3 trillion in destroying this economy
NEVENT : Ask them how they feel about getting bogged down
NEVENT : Well, I've seen some of the figures
NEVENT : Once you start telling Americans the story, -- the administration refuse today tell us story
NEVENT : Tom, you know what liberals want
NEVENT : They don't want a smoking gun, they want a smoking city
NEVENT : The Clinton people all say
NEVENT : Former Congressman, Bob Dornan from California
NEVENT : You're not going to get a smoking city
NEVENT : Time for Fireback, when the viewers fire back at us
NEVENT : Joshua Hosford of Newport Beach, California -- that would be nice in this weathers -- Paul, I guess we're going after all
NEVENT : Case in point, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed
NEVENT : It's amazing how someone can actually do two things at once
NEVENT : Joshua, you couldn't have said anything better
NEVENT : In fact, I've already said it
NEVENT : Well, in fact, our allies got Mr. Mohammed along with us
NEVENT : We need allies
NEVENT : And Bush is so far angered every ally we have
NEVENT : Bush has been torturing Americans for two years. Why should this guy get preferential treatment
NEVENT : And I thought he was -- I thought he was busy running the Redskins
NEVENT : No? OK
NEVENT : The next comment is from Frank Mastro of New York City
NEVENT : Mr.Novak, I don't understand the problem
NEVENT : I say that to all the rich millionaire Democrats, like Carville and Begala, who don't want tax cuts
NEVENT : Pay it anyway
NEVENT : They'll defeat Bush and everybody will get rich
NEVENT : That's a better strategy
NEVENT : David Horn of Long Island, New York, writes, "How can Bush say he's for democracy
NEVENT : Where did he learn to govern, 1930's Chicago
NEVENT : Hi
NEVENT : I'm Paul Avalar (ph) from Tempe, Arizona
NEVENT : I had a question also about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed
NEVENT : That's a great question
