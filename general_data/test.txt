EVENT : I hear though, that he's going to be -- the first person to be (()) um -- uh -- killed for a crime in California in like, thirty five years or something
EVENT : Um -- why, uh, now why did they decide that this was to be this big (()) out of this with the most heinous crime in all of California
EVENT : I mean I guess that's not how they decide who died, but it's because of the
EVENT : they have many many worse crimes going on in California, parents killing their children and everything, that you would think -- would would, um -- you know, be
EVENT : I mean there's like, genocide in Sudan right now but like, nobody talks about that

EVENT : Yeah, uh, I think it's kind of strange how it was so publicized
EVENT : But it just amazes me that, uh, I think it's ridiculous how publicized -- how much publicity it got because -- I mean there's like human rights violations going on all around the world
EVENT : Um (()) it's almost like, uh -- (()) diversion but it just seems like they just make it into like, like a soap opera for people to watch, you know

EVENT : that if -- she had anything to do with this,  I don't think he would ever tell
EVENT : Yeah, he probably did

EVENT : I I didn't actually -- watch the trial very much, uh th- in fact, I didn't watch the trial at all
EVENT : I read about it in the newspaper and things like that
EVENT : I know that he had done a lot of volunteer things before, and that was the one things that made me wonder there was any possible chance that it could have been somebody else who did it
EVENT : I- I think his motive must have been to be with his new girlfriend, but uh- -- kill his own first child that way is extraordinary
EVENT : Death of Arafat
EVENT : Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week
EVENT : Do you think Arafat's death will help or hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
EVENT : What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat has died
EVENT : In which,  the state of Israel buys -- many expensive military weapons,  ah, which is used to -- oppress and -- to kill a lot of Palestinians
EVENT : In which,  the state of Israel buys -- many expensive military weapons,  ah, which is used to -- oppress and -- to kill a lot of Palestinians
EVENT : Um,  well, there's been a couple where -- they've- they talked about the Cabinet -- for -- Bush, and Bush has been,  um,  you know,  selecting new Cabinet members and -- all of the new members are people that I'm- I don't really know very well
EVENT : Well,  um, I would- I would have to start- -- I would have to start, generally, in stating- -- stating what I think is the problem and -- -with the Middle East and what- For me, one of the major problems is the fact that -- the -- United States government gives so much aid to the state of Israel
EVENT : And, um, Yasser Arafat was kind of in a difficult position, because you have these,  um, incredibly -- oppressed and in some ways imprisoned,  uh, Palestinians,  and if -- Arafat hadn't, um, tried to stand up -- and help them and- and fight for their rights, then -- m- they wouldn't have respected Arafat,  but then again, you know, he couldn't be too friendly with the West,  um,  and, um, and so he did the best he could, I think. It's a difficult -- leadership role
EVENT : We can't put it on -- the ro- or the- -- the whole responsibility of the pre- -- peace process can't be the leader of -- a- -- a group that is- -- I don't know, in my view,  has -- not ver- not very many resources to fight- -- to fight this -- battle that -- their trying to fight against -- a government that has taken away a lot of their land,  that,  you know, doesn't allow them to really move around in their own country
EVENT : Other topics -- you know, usually about the election that- -- that, um,  I did have -- a lot of things,  um, to say
EVENT : Death of Arafat
EVENT : Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week
EVENT : Do you think Arafat's death will help or hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
EVENT : What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat has died
EVENT : I really think so. I really, truly do and now it's a- a situation where, with his passing, um, I think there's a real, um, new opening, a new possibility for- -- some extremely positive steps to come forward out of this -- I do think that the United States -- will probably be requested to be involved in the negotiation process and I understand that, I me- uh, because,  um, I think -- both sides -- have a trust in the United States that make it
EVENT : Well, um, where they were going to, uh, give them, like, ninety-six percent of the Ga- of- of Gaza and he said that he wanted all hundred percent
EVENT : They had those retreats and things with the leaders
EVENT : Death of Arafat
EVENT : Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week
EVENT : I think that, um,  his death -- marks a beginning of trying to find somebody that -- really wants peace
EVENT : I think that now he's gone, his family is still around, and
EVENT : but it wasn't actually for peace but was to try to find a way to ((send)) the Israelis out of Jerusalem in the areas that they wanted
EVENT : If you know the Bible well you would know that there's always going to be a conflict there
EVENT : I'd like to -- I know that,  you know, there's been problems, a lot of conflict over there, and it seems like no matter what
EVENT : And I agree that we shouldn't send people over there
EVENT : just like Iraq ye- eh, we try to go in and get peace and- and how long has it been and,  I mean, I think Saddam needed to be removed but it's- -- there's just -- s- all these people that are going to follow him no matter what
EVENT : I think that it was a front -- for him to allow to to be accepted in an international community, but I think -- that his ultimate plans and goals were to to run the Israelis out -- maybe closer to the Gaza strip, and to re-take Jerusalem -- and other cities near Jerusalem,  and to, uh, uplift his people in a way that -- they could say, you know, we conquered the Israelis
EVENT : Do you think Arafat's death will help or hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
EVENT : What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat has died
EVENT : I don't think that we should get involved to a level, a point where we're sending people over there and, um, trying to -- help keep the peace or anything like that,  um
EVENT : I was more,  um,  kind of a -- I was a kid on the run from abusive parents back then so that wasn't a,  you know, one of my topics of interest at the time, it is now
EVENT : Yeah, and, um,  I only know about Yasser Arafat because I, um, study international affairs a little bit -- and I know -- a very little bit about him because, of course he was a, um, leader for a long time, longer than the age that I am -- old, so, but I- I- I- I've noticed -- on throughout my studies that -- what he represented to the public -- was -- what he represented to the international public -- was not what he was representing to his people -- and he was representing, um,  peace with the Israelis and he was representing trying to find ((the whites or)) divide the land so that it would be,  um, stop,  um,  uh, war and terrorists in the area
EVENT : It's a matter of, uh -- I mean, it's more than just land,  it's a, um,  conflict of- -- of,  um, hatred,  uh, and racism, I mean, eh, different types of people, um, they don't like each other
EVENT : I believe he -- -- in my opinion he- he was a good leader -- and, um,  I believe what,  eh, has to be done -- right now is to ((apply)) -- the United Nations', uh,  decisions about the conflict between Arab and Israel because there is -- -- there are a lot of,  uh, decisions have been made -- have been made -- and this, uh- For example, one of them was, uh, decision number two forty-two -- and this was about -- the ha- establishing two- two countries,  one for Israel and another one for Palestine
EVENT : Death of Arafat
EVENT : Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week
EVENT : Do you think Arafat's death will help or hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
EVENT : What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat has died
EVENT : But, eh,  eh, for Israeli, Palestinian conflict there's a lot of decisions that has to be -- applied but until now -- she didn't put any pressure,  eh,  toward ((this and)) and I believe this policy has been, uh,  this kind of policy,  eh,  um,  eh, became more and more during -- eh, during, uh, eh, Bush -- -- President Bush time
EVENT : For example,  when there was, uh, like,  a -- decision against Iraq,  the United States -- went directly -- to Iraq to -- -- for, eh,  uh,  an invasion -- and -- for -- whatever reasons- -- she even was out, uh,  putting any attention to the United Nations,  uh, like, uh,  approval
EVENT : For example, before, eh, during Clinton,  I believe at that time -- Clinton was trying hard -- to solve this problem and I believe at that time, if you remember,  um,  Yasser Arafat -- and, uh, the prime minister of Israel, his name was Barak,  they met together in the White House -- and -- they almost came to an agreement -- to solve this problem -- and during Clinton, eh,  period -- they had, uh, this ((Oslo)) a- eh, agreement
EVENT : I think,  the people,  uh,  the people that are in charge, the- eh, the people that run the governments there -- do need to sit down an- and- and be in touch with each other and if they need a mediator or something like that, that
EVENT : Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
EVENT : Um,  so when they found the baby, the baby of course had been -- they don't know if the baby was born, through delivery,  or -- if maybe from um -- the corpse I guess
EVENT : But,  actually they were trying to pass a law, and I don't know if it ever did take into effect,  that if in fact a mother was killed, and pregnant,  um -- for there to be a double murder charge
EVENT : Um,  I guess because he didn't murder the baby directly
EVENT : Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
EVENT : Criminal Trials
EVENT : Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death penalty
EVENT : There's been a lot of media coverage of the Peterson trial
EVENT : Why do you think this trial has been so publicized
EVENT : What other criminal trials have gotten a lot of media attention, and why
EVENT : What's the most memorable criminal trial you can recall
EVENT : Uh, what do you know about this Scott -- Peterson trial
EVENT : And they're making the determination if -- in fact he will get the death penalty, or life in prison
EVENT : But,  actually they were trying to pass a law, and I don't know if it ever did take into effect,  that if in fact a mother was killed, and pregnant,  um -- for there to be a double murder charge
EVENT : And -- so it's kind of up in the air now -- because he -- I believe he got first degree murder and -- um and then got manslaughter on the baby
EVENT : And -- so it's kind of up in the air now -- because he -- I believe he got first degree murder and -- um and then got manslaughter on the baby
EVENT : So he didn't get both first degree murders
EVENT : And because of the the charge on the baby, they couldn't automatically give him the death penalty, but -- obviously there's enough -- um, complaints or whatever
EVENT : And because of the the charge on the baby, they couldn't automatically give him the death penalty, but -- obviously there's enough -- um, complaints or whatever
EVENT : And actually I don't even think they were married that long, maybe a year or two
EVENT : And -- they were in fact trying to enforce the death penalty on that charge if they were -- found guilty on both charges
EVENT : Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election
EVENT : ever, I usually try to stay out of the main party, because I think, and this last election showed that both are very brutal
EVENT : Well, you kind of hit on some of my sentiments, um, I'm a fifty-year- old black male,  and this was my first election that I participated in
EVENT : Yeah, I guess the elections, ah -- basically, who did you vote for, and the vice presidential candidates, and why, and I'll be honest with you
EVENT : It was a very brutal election
EVENT : and, ah -- I mean, and, and a lot of it has to do -- and then, I just didn't know much, John Edwards seemed nice, but he just, you know, he was just, he just got elected to the Senate,  and,  I wasn't really familiar too much with hi- I mean, I think it's great that he got into the vice presidential role, but -- again, it's the whole parties that I'm really not really I don't like their policies
EVENT : And the reason was was that, ah, I'm retired Air Force -- and before, ah, because I was in the military -- ah, didn't didn't really think that my vote, um, counted one way or the other, that's that was my thinking
EVENT : Yes, I feel very, very bad in regards to the, ah, nine-eleven tragedy and terrorism and this kind of stuff
EVENT : Yes, I feel very, very bad in regards to the, ah, nine-eleven tragedy and terrorism and this kind of stuff
EVENT : In fact, we just got back from Disney World,  you know, about an hour ago and they're down there and they're but they're both, uh
EVENT : and, um,  but then -- Edwards fought back kind of -- you know and then all the stuff you hear about Edwards too, about the, uh,  how he's a trial lawyer and how he made all his millions -- suing insurance companies and, um, you know, there- there's -- bad stuff you hear about both of them that, you know, obviously they want to tell you
EVENT : Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election
EVENT : Um, man I thought I, uh,  put this whole election stuff behind me
EVENT : And, um, elections wore me down
EVENT : Yeah, I- in fact, I thought we already had a discussion on this, uh, about elections some time back, but I guess it was -- question was framed differently, I guess
EVENT : and, um,  but then -- Edwards fought back kind of -- you know and then all the stuff you hear about Edwards too, about the, uh,  how he's a trial lawyer and how he made all his millions -- suing insurance companies and, um, you know, there- there's -- bad stuff you hear about both of them that, you know, obviously they want to tell you
EVENT : Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election
EVENT : So, uh the election, um -- the, um -- let's see, overall I felt -- ju- just give you a brief -- summary, I felt -- that -- John Kerry and Edwards were were pretty strong candidates and -- uh -- mm, I don't know, I guess just in terms of policy I didn't -- I didn't, uh, find -- that as compelling as just -- the personality of -- the different candidates
EVENT : And all the meetings he's missing, and just, you know, I think it's more of a status quo for him
EVENT : And I -- felt like, hm -- if we're trying to, um -- make -- um -- the United States safer and more stable -- conflict in the world more stable then we probably need somebody -- who is a little bit more -- of a politician in the sense that -- the, they care about diplomacy and -- uh, even though we may not -- give in to -- the will of the other nations present it in a nicer way
EVENT : Do you think, um -- the -- when the Republicans are campaigning -- they were saying that well, another attack on the U.S. is -- imminent, that it probably -- probably going to happen -- and -- um -- and -- they even went so far to say that if -- it's really difficult to prevent something like this and of course they're doing the best they can and -- I think Kerry would do the best he could
EVENT : But do you think, um -- that -- and this isn't quite a political issue, but do you think that -- there's going to be another attack on the ~US
EVENT : You know, it's been going on for all these many -- what
EVENT : I'd say my overall opinion is that -- this conflict is way past that time
EVENT : hundreds of years -- and a lot of people have lost their lives, and and a lot of kids have grown up and all they've ever known -- on both sides Israeli and Palestinian, all they've ever known is war
EVENT : hundreds of years -- and a lot of people have lost their lives, and and a lot of kids have grown up and all they've ever known -- on both sides Israeli and Palestinian, all they've ever known is war
EVENT : It's like a never ending circle of violence and death and destruction
EVENT : PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death
EVENT : PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death
EVENT : What do you think of Israel's policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death
EVENT : Yeah, was good enough, just to show -- the Palestinian people -- that, uh you know, America does care somewhat -- that you've lost your leader
EVENT : Death of Arafat
EVENT : What do you think caused his illness, and could it have been something malicious (like poisoning
EVENT : but it wasn't -- like, ah, wasn't Bush, I definitely wouldn't send him, I don't think you want to have him in that part of the world right now
EVENT : It's like a never ending circle of violence and death and destruction
EVENT : What do you think caused his illness, and could it have been something malicious (like poisoning
EVENT : Yeah, I don't think he was poisoned
EVENT : Well, I I don't remember who they sent, but they did send over some very -- low level state department person
EVENT : But, uh, at at least for the ceremony in Egypt I think, uh,  I can understand that no one would want to go into -- Palestinian territory
EVENT : Death of Arafat
EVENT : PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death
EVENT : What do you think of Israel's policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death
EVENT : Well, I I guess now that that he's he's died -- it'll be, uh,  or it it should be a change for the ~PLO
EVENT : He he seems like a guy who is much more comfortable -- being under siege than in negotiating peace settlements
EVENT : You know, if he if he made peace he had factions of his own people that would've killed him -- and if he didn't make peace, eh, then he's considered, you know, the the warmongering, uh, man who won't make peace, you know
EVENT : And, uh,  it would've -- gone an- a little farther to encourage them to, you know, be willing to sit down at the table with us, at least, you know
EVENT : Death of Arafat
EVENT : What do you think caused his illness, and could it have been something malicious (like poisoning
EVENT : PLO leader PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death
EVENT : What do you think of Israel's policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death
EVENT : He's- I mean, like, you know, let's- i- -- for- for all he did in his later years, eh, Yasser Arafat was responsible for -- a good chunk of al- you know, a lot of -- Israeli dying -- i- you know
EVENT : They're fi- they don't even know why they're fighting anymore
EVENT : And it's and it's it's you know,  a war of attrition
EVENT : It's either, you know,  you may kill me, but I'm going to kill all of you before- y- you know what I mean
EVENT : It's either, you know,  you may kill me, but I'm going to kill all of you before- y- you know what I mean
EVENT : It's either, you know,  you may kill me, but I'm going to kill all of you before- y- you know what I mean
EVENT : It's either, you know,  you may kill me, but I'm going to kill all of you before- y- you know what I mean
EVENT : Oh, forget about kicked out or overthrown, he would've been killed
EVENT : Oh, forget about kicked out or overthrown, he would've been killed
EVENT : He was he was basically -- I mean, I've read I've read articles an- and- and- and -- stories that basically have linked him to the to the to the Munich -- massacre -- th- you know, the Munich Olympic massacre th- the Is- the Israeli team
EVENT : He was he was basically -- I mean, I've read I've read articles an- and- and- and -- stories that basically have linked him to the to the to the Munich -- massacre -- th- you know, the Munich Olympic massacre th- the Is- the Israeli team
EVENT : Yeah, okay, um, ((lot of question)) -- and, um,  I- I don't think it was poisoning, even though I haven't read -- a lot of articles about it
EVENT : Well, in other words eh, in other -- when -- after World War Two when they when -- basically the state of Israel was formed
EVENT : Um,  you know, you- e- -- granted, you know, there were there were Jewish people already living there,  but -- all the Jewish people started going there and they j- basically just- you know, they just took over
EVENT : There were -- two very strong -- militant groups that were Israeli and they -- committed a lot of terrorist acts
EVENT : So, I mean, i- -- you know,  uh, how we consider -- Arafat a terrorist,  we also should consider that -- could've been, in some ways, a reaction to some of the terrorism that was -- initially -- committed by the Israelis
EVENT : But if Arafat hadn't been I don't know if he's -- directly -- been linked to Hamas' acts,  uh,  but he was put in a -- pretty -- sticky situation having to negotiate -- the militants of -- Palestine -- the international leaders -- and if it if Hara- Arafat hadn't -- somehow appeased -- the Hamas groups or the Palestinian militants,  then -- he would've been kicked out,  overthrown -- by- -- by the Palestinians
EVENT : PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his illness and death
EVENT : Well -- I, uh, I don't think there was anything malicious, uh, in terms of his death -- uh, just looking at him these last, uh, couple of years uh, it seems like he had Alzheimer's or something
EVENT : And then you got suicide bombing on the one side, and then you got Israel -- you know, it's like one day, you'll he- a bomb will go off, the next day Israel will do and air strike and -- you know, it's like going around in a circle
EVENT : And then you got suicide bombing on the one side, and then you got Israel -- you know, it's like one day, you'll he- a bomb will go off, the next day Israel will do and air strike and -- you know, it's like going around in a circle

EVENT : yeah, they're- where they're coming home from the war and they -- yeah, they're- they're pretty much homeless and- and ha- they have nothing
EVENT : You know, you're sending these guys over there and you want them to be at peace of mind, you know, they- you want them to be able to fight, you know
EVENT : We're going over there, we're saying,  look, this is how we do it -- and, um, i- -- so we think everybody else should be that way
EVENT : The US is currently engaged in major fighting in Fallujah, Iraq
EVENT : War in Iraq
EVENT : right -- a little bit right after the war started in Iraq there was a soldier that spoke out and he got reprimanded for it
EVENT : uh, spoke out against the war publicly and he got reprimanded for it
EVENT : I have -- my cousin's getting ready to go over there and it just, oh, it just makes me sick
EVENT : But my dad was in the army and he was in Vietnam war and he's like, this is crazy, you know
EVENT : I agree with my dad and, you know, if anybody should know it's someone that fought in a war, you know
EVENT : Well, you he- you hear these people saying that, I mean, that are in the mili- military you- you -- that it sa- you- some people who have come back home already and everything that they don't agree with the whole thing
EVENT : Yeah, I mean, and and here are these military guys giving their lives, and working hard every day through training and stuff even if there isn't a war
EVENT : yeah, they're- where they're coming home from the war and they -- yeah, they're- they're pretty much homeless and- and ha- they have nothing
EVENT : You know, you're sending these guys over there and you want them to be at peace of mind, you know, they- you want them to be able to fight, you know
EVENT : Yeah, and they c- the come home to nothing after g- all they've gone through they come home and they have nothing
EVENT : Yeah, and they c- the come home to nothing after g- all they've gone through they come home and they have nothing
EVENT : he didn't get his papers where he's going to be c- -- he's in upstate New York right now but he's going to -- have to probably go back to- to either Iraq or Af- Afghanistan
EVENT : I- I didn't know they could send them more than once
EVENT : Eh, he quit, or he resigned
EVENT : That's why his father didn't want to invade Iraq, because of all these problems they're having now
EVENT : Look at what happened a couple days ago, they killed, um,  like seventy people
EVENT : I don't know why- how he got elected, I mean, there's a lot of people that did vote
EVENT : Well, but, I mean, you know, I don't see what he's doing, I mean, look all the people that are leaving his cabinet -- and their calling for, um, Run- Rumsfeld's regigna- resignation and, uh,  even John McCain, he's a Republican, he wants him -- -- he wants Rumsfeld to get out of there
EVENT : Well, but, I mean, you know, I don't see what he's doing, I mean, look all the people that are leaving his cabinet -- and their calling for, um, Run- Rumsfeld's regigna- resignation and, uh,  even John McCain, he's a Republican, he wants him -- -- he wants Rumsfeld to get out of there
EVENT : I mean, look all the people that are leaving his cabinet -- and their calling for, um, Run- Rumsfeld's regigna- resignation and, uh,  even John McCain, he's a Republican, he wants him -- -- he wants Rumsfeld to get out of there
EVENT : has resigned
EVENT : War in Iraq
EVENT : The US is currently engaged in major fighting in Fallujah, Iraq
EVENT : Much of the country is unstable, but national elections are still scheduled to take place in Iraq in January
EVENT : Do you think the elections scheduled for January will take place, and if not, then what
EVENT : Well, I have a nephew, he just got back from Iraq
EVENT : He was in the army and he's going to probably be going to Afghanistan he told me
EVENT : Well, yeah, and and they named another one and he resigned
EVENT : Well, yeah, and and they named another one and he resigned
EVENT : Eh, he quit, or he resigned
EVENT : Yeah, it's all -- you know, I I I don't know if we're doing the right thing because now look at Iran, what are we going to be, uh,  and he he's talking about trying to invade Iran now
EVENT : Um, yeah, ok- um, eh,  uh, it was talking something about, uh,  the war in Iraq, um,  I guess, yeah, it's a good thing -- about the elections that are going on
EVENT : Um, yeah, ok- um, eh,  uh, it was talking something about, uh,  the war in Iraq, um,  I guess, yeah, it's a good thing -- about the elections that are going on
EVENT : War in Iraq
EVENT : Do you support the -- do you- do you support the war
EVENT : Do you support the war
EVENT : Yeah, I did at first I just- I just -- I -- don't like the way it was managed
EVENT : Yeah, I- I mean, I- I did support the war
EVENT : The US is currently engaged in major fighting in Fallujah, Iraq
EVENT : Do you think the elections are going to happen
EVENT : Much of the country is unstable, but national elections are still scheduled to take place in Iraq in January
EVENT : do you think the elections are going to happen
EVENT : And assist them with the elections and they need to complete the elections and all this
EVENT : And assist them with the elections and they need to complete the elections and all this
EVENT : I just talked to somebody from ~LA a couple days ago about that on the -- survey line
EVENT : Yeah, I think the -- I think they're still they're going to go through even though, uh, even though,  um, what's it called,  that you know of all the -- turmoil that's happening there and all of the argu- you know, and all the -- killings and everything
EVENT : They kept on scheduling them and they we're saying, oh, no no no, you know
EVENT : Um,  yeah, I think -- you know I think they should have continued to go through with it, and you know um -- if- if there is -- if there's problems, you know, just -- still -- don't, you know -- just ignore it, keep going, you know you can't -- stop, you know,if you already started something, you know, you should complete it, I think
EVENT : I know they set up the council,  uh, interim council, but that hasn't gone,  you know, perfe- smoothly
EVENT : So, if they can just sort of make a -- be- get into more of a supportive role and,  you know, flex their muscles when they need to and maybe that will help- help,  uh,  squall some of the vi- the violence
EVENT : I don't know if that could, uh,  if that's a -- plausible goal or not because, uh, it's just that- that -- a lot of that's, you know,  uh, weapons and terrorists have been, you know, getting through the borders, probably from Syria
EVENT : Do you think the elections scheduled for January will take place, and if not, then what
NEVENT : Thank you both for a very interesting debate
NEVENT : In a minute we will look at His Holiness, John Paul II's efforts to be a peacemaker
NEVENT : Later, the author of "Vanity Fair's" scary new look at the King of Pop, Michael Jackson
NEVENT : You will not want to miss this
NEVENT : Stay with us
NEVENT : Welcome back to CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : Maybe it's just me, but I think Michael Jackson, he's kooky, wacky
NEVENT : I recall, as reported in 'The Wall Street Journal,' that the transactions were legal
NEVENT : Is it possible that the equipment allowed Iraq to produce oil for the Oil for Food program authorized by the U.N.
NEVENT : They were legal because Mr.Cheney's company used a loophole
NEVENT : They went through a foreign subsidiary
NEVENT : But they did enrich Saddam Hussein and his evil, ruthless regime, and they were immoral
NEVENT : They were wrong
NEVENT : Dick Cheney should have never profited off of doing business with Saddam Hussein
NEVENT : I would agree with that
NEVENT : It means Cheney is a hypocrite
NEVENT : Well it's a complete
NEVENT : That's great
NEVENT : Well yesterday he was a valued customer, today he's an even villain
NEVENT : Right. So we're against Dick Cheney, but that doesn't have anything to do with Saddam Hussein
NEVENT : It must be the humanitarian reasons
NEVENT : Well, Chad, that's what liberals assume
NEVENT : It is a weird assumption, don't you think
NEVENT : As you know, I've never said that
NEVENT : You haven't
NEVENT : It's called democracy
NEVENT : Those leaders are reflecting the views of their people
NEVENT : They hate America, Paul
NEVENT : My name is Christina Wright (ph)
NEVENT : I'm from Minneapolis, Minnesota
NEVENT : It might
NEVENT : I mean that's absolutely one of the fears
NEVENT : That it would destabilize the entire region
NEVENT : So the question is, could it be worse
NEVENT : Our president believes it will set off a positive domino effect of democracy through the region
NEVENT : Maybe he's right
NEVENT : I don't think he's thought it through
NEVENT : I think it's more likely that this very unstable region could cause even more problem
NEVENT : Oh, come on
NEVENT : That's silly
NEVENT : Hi. I'm Fabian from Bonn, Germany
NEVENT : It's actually Western Europe, because 18 European countries are on the side of the United States. So France and Germany -- that's actually true -- find themselves in the minority on their own continent
NEVENT : And good
NEVENT : Only Great Britain is with us
NEVENT : The only country
NEVENT : What do you mean only Great Britain
NEVENT : My question is not who votes at the U.N.
NEVENT : Nobody except Great Britain
NEVENT : We are isolated
NEVENT : From the left, I am Paul Begala
NEVENT : Goodnight for CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : From the right, I'm Tucker Carlson
NEVENT : Join us again tomorrow night for yet more CROSSFIRE
NEVENT : Their military service goes back to the Vietnam era
NEVENT : Others, though, are novices
NEVENT : They are, we are told, well trained
NEVENT : This is a messy business
NEVENT : In the spring of 1970, a squad of U.S. soldiers spotted a small unit of Viet Cong that had been circling for days
NEVENT : And what's that like
NEVENT : That's one of those introspective times where it's just -- it's just an introspective time, not a public time
NEVENT : After his first, he returned to a ship deck full of sailors and crew cheering, shaking his hand, pushing in to slap his back
NEVENT : And one of the guys looked at me and says
NEVENT : And, all of a sudden, bang, it just hit me
NEVENT : You don't think about those things
NEVENT : And it's removed
NEVENT : It's far off
NEVENT : It's not in close
NEVENT : Of all the wounds time does not heal, the ones that fester deep in the soul are the wounds you inflict
NEVENT : It's not something that civilized people do
NEVENT : You don't -- it's just not -- it's not a matter of being tormented, but troubled in the sense that that's not what we do, unless we're called upon to do it, under the most extreme set of circumstance
NEVENT : Training bridges that gap
NEVENT : So your choices are not varied
NEVENT : It's very simple
NEVENT : And so you do what you're trained to do
NEVENT : You do what you're there to do
NEVENT : And, in Vietnam, it was body count
NEVENT : It's hard to explain what training can do
NEVENT : Training sets your mind to respond not to common sense and judgment, but to training
NEVENT : You really don't have time to think: I'm going the wrong way
NEVENT : I should be going the other way
NEVENT : He won a Bronze Star
NEVENT : Nobody is looking for medals
NEVENT : Everyone wants to live another day
NEVENT : Don't misunderstand
NEVENT : Maybe that's a good thing
NEVENT : Candy Crowley, CNN, Washington
NEVENT : Remarkable interviews and a reminder that what these men and women are going through right now in Iraq, they will remember for the rest of their lives
NEVENT : That's our coverage this hour
NEVENT : Who looks out for the unlikely prospect of Iraqi aircraft, and the more likely prospect of Iraqi missiles or artillery
NEVENT : Does your mindset change across the border into Iraq
NEVENT : No, because I am in an area which I don't know where the enemy could be and I might get to the airplane, by the time I get out of the airplane I'm thinking the same way
NEVENT : The hair on the back of my neck starts standing up, then something's going wrong
NEVENT : As a precaution, the crew starts turning the huge plane in circles to see what the targets do
NEVENT : Ultimately it's discovered the targets are U.S. combat helicopters
NEVENT : Minutes later the search and rescue helicopter arrives for its refueling
NEVENT : Watch the flash from our night vision camera as the plane's fuel line connects with the chopper
NEVENT : Both aircraft fly at 125 miles per hour gingerly over enemy land
NEVENT : At times they are only 50 feet apart with the chopper's rotor blades getting closer
NEVENT : Looking with the naked eye out of the plane, the helicopter is impossible to see
NEVENT : The pitch-black maneuver ends after 10 minutes
NEVENT : Again, we know where we're going
NEVENT : We all fly with bulletproof vests in case the plane goes down
NEVENT : We also fly with parachutes in case we need to get out before the plane goes down
NEVENT : But three airmen aboard this plane have parachutes for a different reason
NEVENT : They are the Pararescue jumpers, or PJs who jump off the plane for rescue missions
NEVENT : I mean it's probably the most - the best feeling in the world knowing that your purpose is really defined at that moment
NEVENT : No rescues were necessary on this sortie
NEVENT : Do you have any fear
NEVENT : Everybody has a little bit of fear but I think it's a good thing in this circumstance
NEVENT : This crew could be back on another mission in as few as 24 hours
NEVENT : This is a very busy base
NEVENT : We want to give you a look right now at the aircraft coming in for landings
NEVENT : It looks like LAX on a Sunday night and this is what it's been like for the past 11 days
NEVENT : We have just watched multitudes of warplanes land, multitudes of warplanes take off and this may be the busiest night of the campaign
NEVENT : Wolf, back to you
NEVENT : That's a lot of bombs and missiles
NEVENT : Gary Tuchman in an air base near the Iraq border, thanks very much, Gary Tuchman
NEVENT : General Richard Myers will be my special guest on a special late addition
NEVENT : That's at noon Eastern, nine A.M
NEVENT : Pacific tomorrow
NEVENT : That's Sunday and I'll be back Judy and at the top of the hour for Wolf Blitzer Reports
NEVENT : We'll have a complete wrap of all the day's late breaking developments
NEVENT : In the meantime, back to Judy Woodruff in Washington
NEVENT : We'll be watching you both times at the top of the hour and certainly for late edition on Sunday
NEVENT : Thanks Wolf
NEVENT : Greg Milam is with the U.K. forces in southern Iraq
NEVENT : Seemingly deserted, these battered buildings hold a deadly threat to British forces in Iraq
NEVENT : This is what we're coming across a lot of these, 30 mil, 60 mil, 80 mil, even 120 mil
NEVENT : So there's plenty still out there that will have to be recovered because they can be used
NEVENT : Do you know when this place was last used
NEVENT : I mean do you know
NEVENT : I'm not too sure but judging by some of this, it's been here quite a long time so whether it's been used recently by them - there was an Intel upbeat saying that they were possibly coming back to try and get this to use against them
NEVENT : Grenades, mortars, all sorts of ammunition abandoned by Iraqi soldiers but there for the taking
NEVENT : The job of these Royal Engineers is to clear this and many other mountains of armaments and destroy them
NEVENT : Some are too unstable to be moved and have to be blown up on the spot
NEVENT : The rest is carried way out into the desert
NEVENT : With the coalition forces moving forward the last thing they want is weaponry like this lurking behind them
NEVENT : With the amounts of ammunition and weapons left about, if they'd used those systems, that amount of weapon it would have given us a considerable amount of trouble trying to take the positions
NEVENT : With much of this weaponry there is only one safe thing to do
NEVENT : No one in the British forces here is willing to take any risks
NEVENT : Greg Milam, Sky News, Southern Iraq
